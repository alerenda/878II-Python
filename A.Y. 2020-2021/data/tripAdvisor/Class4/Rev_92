'My granddaughter and I had just completed a tour of Italy and i wanted her to see Paris if only for a day.I booked the Westin because I had stayed numerous times when it was an Intercontinental.I requested a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower, which we got. The room was very small as was the bath but it was only for 1 nite, so no big problem. I ordered a car from the airport,which was an outrageous 165 euros.( I was in Paris the previous month on business and I had a car from a different hotel for 95 euros) The hotel is located at place vendome,along side the Tuilleries and several blocks from the Louvre,and a short walk to the river. The best location you can have in Paris. The staff was amazing and just so helpful and friendly.The driver of the very expensive car was great. When i told him we only had one day he stopped at the trocodero so that my granddaughter could take pictures, same with arc de triomphe, place vendome, place de la concorde,etc. One great day in Paris. Price for hotel,lunch,transport from airport, internet was over $900.00.( that hotel allows you to charge in dollars). Incidentally a taxi to the airport was45 euros. Costly 24 hours but truly worth it Room Tip: The rooms with a great view are much smaller than the rooms with a not so great view See more room tips'
