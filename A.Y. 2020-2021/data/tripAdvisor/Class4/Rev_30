'we stayed at the villa nais on our easter trip to barcelona and we really liked it! the owner is a very friendly and service oriented woman, that makes fantastic local breakfast and accomodated all our wishes (cheese for breakfast etc.). we stayed in two rooms during our stay due to the one room was booked and i actually thought both rooms were really nice & lying by the pool made it just great. you need a car though.. then you can explore the great little places surrounding this little inn. we would definitly go back, it is not a 5 star but a great value for this region and price! Thank you for the nice stay'
