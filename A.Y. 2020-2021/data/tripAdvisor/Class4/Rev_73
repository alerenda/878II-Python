'We came to Cancun only for 1 night before our flight to Mexico city. We booked this night in the Poc-na hotel in Isla mujeres for 350 pesos. We got a double room, with 2 not too big double beds, private bathroom, towels, 2 bottles of water, TV and a bit noisy AC. Continental breakfast, tasty enough, was included. The crew was kind and hospitable. They helped with taxis and directions. All in all we enjoyed our stay and considering the price it seemed like a good value.'
