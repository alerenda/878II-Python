'imperial las perlas is my favorite hotel in cancun,I,ve been there already 4 years in a row,and planing to go back next year again. these hotel is maybe not brand new and luxury,but it's easy and simple,you got everything you need,and after a couple of days you feel like a member of a big family,I really like all the people working there and making my stay as nice as possible! Kevin and his party/animation crew are already friends of mine,and one of the main reason to come back every year again! So,if you like,to meet new people,from all over the world,and not looking forward to see snobbishly people,these is the right place for you! Always again Alex,Germany'
