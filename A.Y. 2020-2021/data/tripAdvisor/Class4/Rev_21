'I was looking a hotel not in the Zona Hotelera cause I was going there to see the ruins, if u wanna also go to the beach u can take a bus and go to the public beach, but I found it very reasonable the price for what I was looking for. The breakfast was in included on the price, was very basic but u leave ready to starting your adventures, the bus station its 2 blocks away and they take you everywhere around Cancun. So if u are not thinking in a all inclusive hotel and low budget I think its worth it.'
