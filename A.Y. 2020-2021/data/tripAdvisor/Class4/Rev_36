'My family and I stayed at the Venetian for 1 week 27th May- 3rd June and I would agree with all other reviews about lovely rooms, great houskeeping, friendly staff etc. When we go to Vegas we like to spend a bit of time relaxing by the pool, not all day, but a few hours in the morning and maybe a few more late afternoon. I am 50 years old but not past it and very easy going, therefore I do not complain often but my one big disappointment was the noise from the Tao beach club next to the main pool. Even with ear phones and locating as far away as possible it was impossible to escape the thumping beat coming from there. My question to the Venetian is, "do you want to be a high end hotel resort or do you want to attact the younger crowd"? ($30 entry charge per person to Tao Beach) because I think you can not be both and neither did the many other people I heard complaining about the same thing. I have stayed at the Bellagio and their pool area is better and certainly more peaceful and for that reason would stay there ahead of the Venetian on my next visit'
