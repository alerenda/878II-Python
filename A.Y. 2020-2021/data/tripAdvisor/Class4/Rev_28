'Just got back from Benidorm and stayed at Don Miguel 1 for 1 week. We were on 3rd floor and had a lovely apartment, The accommodation was excellent and had stunning views and was very convenient for us as we are over 60 and found everything close by the apartment. some negatives were that we arrived on a Sunday evening very late and we had to take a taxi to pick up the keys which was at Bueno vista apartments and cost 7eoros to get back to Don Miguel 1. Also on leaving the apartment also Sunday we had to take the keys back again to Bueno Vista and pay another 12 Euros. I suggest that people take a travel kettle as the kettle goes on to the stove and takes a bit of time to boil. The other facilities were excellent in the apartment . I would recommend these apartments but make sure next time arrival and departure times are within the opening hours of Findus real estate so that the keys are a bit closer to the apartment. This agent is about a 10 minute walk from the apartment. Due to our late flight time we were able to pay 20 euros to stay a little longer in he apartment after check out time. I would definitely stay there again but make sure we had early flights to pick up keys from the agent. veryon a Sunday evening'
