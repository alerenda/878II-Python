'This is a popular place for locals and tourists. The property has a decent size of outdoor pool, a restaurant/bar and beautiful gardens with tropical treas and flowers. You can easily spot yacht lovers and scuba-divers in the pool. You can take an express bus from the airport to downtown Cancun and then take bus number R1 to this hotel. You can get off near Barcelo Cancun or Ferry to Island Mujeres. It is across from Barcelo Cancun Hotel. If you need to get a toothbrush or light meal, try the small convenient store outside the hotel. It is on your left side when you walk out of the hotel. It is an absolutely beautiful and relaxing place but can be noisy by a sudden police visit to next door at night. (only one night) A soundproof room is not guaranteed but a solid metal lock on door ensures your safety. Room Tip: Stay away from other guests with babies(noise) See more room tips'
