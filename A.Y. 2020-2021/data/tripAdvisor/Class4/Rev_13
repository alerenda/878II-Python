'We loved renting from Michelle and Peter so much the first time, that we decided to come back a short couple of months later to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. Any issues that arose this time around, Michelle and Peter were on top of it within minutes. Anyone that has issues with their room should speak to them to get things corrected instead of leaving negative feedback before they even have a chance to solve or help you with the problem. The Solymar is not the "Ritz". If you want a clean and inexpensive place to stay in Cancun, this is where to go(rent with Michelle and Peter Hermick). DO NOT get the all inclusive at the Solymar. The food is terrible and the drinks are watered down. I prefered utilizing the kitchenette and cooked breakfast and lunches. This allowed us to choose the many different restaurants Cancun has to offer. The beach makes up for what the Solymar lacks.'
