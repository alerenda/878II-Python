'I found the condo we rented at the villas marlin through ownersdirect.com. This was my first time booking like this and not staying at an all inclusive. It was everything I thought it would be. The accomodations are not 5 star but the unit was clean, comfortable and had a spectacular view of the ocean. The location was amazing. Walking distance to restaurants/shopping and a short bus ride to the "club area". The beach was immaculate. Probably one of the nicest beach fronts in the hotel zone. The complex was very safe. 24 hour security on all sides. The outdoor pool was clean and the little bar to buy drinks was very reasonable...lots of fun was had. the hot tubs are not heated, they have to be turned on and even then they don't get hot hot, but when its 28 degrees outside who cares. Took the ferry over the Isle of Mujeres. Rented golf carts and hit a beach bar. Took the bus down to Playa Del Carmen for some shopping. Didn't buy much as the prices were cheaper in Cancun but it was great atmosphere and again we hit a beach bar. All in all I liked this experience more than an all inclusive. Didn't use the kitchen but it was fully equipped with everything you would need to prepare and eat a normal meal. Even though we didn't bring the kids this time it would be a great location. It appeared that there was a little of everyone from locals to snowbirds staying at this place so it was nice and quiet but all you have to do is take a walk along the beach and if you are looking for something a little more crazy you can find it...but it's nice when it's not happening at your place.'
