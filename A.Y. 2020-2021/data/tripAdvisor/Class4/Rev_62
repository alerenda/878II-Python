'My partner and I stayed here for a short break after our wedding the week before.First impressions of the hotel were good untill we got to our room,we had booked a double room and found it to be a twin (we had to push the beds togeather-it was part of our honeymoon! Plus the beds were ROCK HARD! Other wise it was a pleasant stay,Good location for bus/metro (pavlova) . The room was clean,good size bathroom.There was a mini bar fridge also but no tea/coffee facilities but you could order drinks from reception.Also I would suggest that they install air con as it was boiling in the room so it was either boil or open the windows and have the loud noise of the traffic speeding by all through the night.The staff were polite and helpfull.We really enjoyed Prague and will be back,bit of advice-be prepared for a lot of walking so pack your comfy shoes! The traffic is crazy so keep your wits about you,use the crossings.'
