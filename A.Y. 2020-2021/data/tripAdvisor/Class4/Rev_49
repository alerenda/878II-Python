'The hotel is located close to the sea, and the old citycentre. The location is really good, nice seaview! The hotel looks very modern, big and clean. The room was good, clean but not spectacular. I think you pay a lot for the views and the location. The breakfast was good, a lot of choise. It's better to book only the breakfast, and not the diner, because it's not that good. The swimmingpool is nice. The hotel is good for couples or a group adults, but not really for childeren.'
