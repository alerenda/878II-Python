'Just back from Benidorm, just a three day break. Great Hotel, nice large clean rooms, sea views. Staff very helpful and friendly. Good location, hotel right near the beach. Very central. Just a short walk to the Old Town, which was great, narrow streets great tapas bars and there you will find alot of the spanish people enjoying the resturants and bars. If you want clubs where they have live tribute bands and comedy clubs then go down to the strip in the new town, there are loads to choose from. We had a good night in the Comedy club, very lively, alot of hen and stag groups. Enjoyed our short break, but we would have liked some better weather.'
