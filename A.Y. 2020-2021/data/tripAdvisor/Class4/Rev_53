'Actually this hotel is in Puerto Juarez, just outside Cancun, about a 30 min walk to the tip of the hotel zone. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I used the hotel as the base for four excursions: Isle Mujeres, Xcaret, Chichen Itza, and Tulum/ Xel-Ha, and had no problems getting back to this hotel in the evening. Was a great value for what I got.'
