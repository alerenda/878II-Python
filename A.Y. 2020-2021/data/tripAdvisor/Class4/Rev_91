'In June we, my husband and our son of 9 months and I, stayed for a week at Geco Resort at Favignana. And we loved it! Geco Resort is a paradise on a paradise. Favignana is a lovely and beautiful island with its Cala Azzuro and Cala Rosso, the cosy village, Lido Beach and much more.The people are very friendly. And the food is delicious! Geco Resort offers all you need for a perfect stay on this island. Our room was very cosy and clean. It is very tranquille. At night you do not hear a thing! Every morning we enjoyed having our breakfast on our own large terrace. We loved walking to the beach, Lido Beach, with our son in his stroller. When we didn’t feel like going the beach we found it very relaxing to stay at the pool. Very quiet! Our son Luca also had a great time swimming in the pool. After our swim we enjoyed the tranquility of the beautiful and well taken care of garden and the view of the olivetree yard of Antonio. Geco Resort is situated only 5 minutes walking of the village. The village offers a nice variety of places to eat. Antonio and Paula are more than willing to advise you where to go. We love looking back on our stay at Favignana and at Geco Resort. We have good memories. When we were back home we felt 'homesick' for a whole week. Antonio and Paula are a lovely and helpful couple. We are dying to return. Bob, Rosa e Luca PS As we were the first people from The Netherlands to stay at Geco Resort we hope more Dutch people will follow'
