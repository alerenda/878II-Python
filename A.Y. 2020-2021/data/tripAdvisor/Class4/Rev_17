'I'm going to be brutally honest, this is not the best hotel I have stayed in. BUT the location is brilliant, the staff are fantastic, the beds are good and the towels are changed every day. All in all it was great. However, and this is a vry big however, the food is TERRIBLE, as in inedible for me. The first day we were in the dining room there was a cocroach but we persereved and ate breakfast the next day (attempted to). It was not great as it lacked fresh fruit (or fruit of any kind) and yoghurt. So, stay here for the price, location, staff, pool deck and service but aim to eat out all the time. To be fair to Qwara there are some excellent local restaurants close by, we could eat a two course meal with wine for 30 euros easily and two of the best restaurants we found were right round the corner from the hotel.'
