'The hotel is at the begining of "Walking Street" and is therefore within easy reach of the beach, restaurants and most of the gay pubs and clubs. The accommodation is adequate given the price and it is noisy. The room had a sink and a shower and the only shared facility was a toilet. All were immaculate. The only downsides were as I said the noise and the lack of air conditioning. Going to the other Hotel Bristol to have breakfast ans use the pool was not an issue from my point of view. The breakfast was quite poor quality, but then it didnt cost alot and there are other options in the Old Town.'
