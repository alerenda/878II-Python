'Even when the entrance and first aisle to the rooms aren't great and neither the cleanest ones, we had a perfectly clean room on the first floor which was spotless. The staff was very kind, also the beds and pillows were very comfortable and even when it was noisy because the bar at the entrance, the room was isolated and we heard nothing. The only problem we noticed at night was a very strong smell from the bathroom which wasn't there when we arrived. Besides that, it's perfectly located across the street of the ADO bus station, and on the other corner there is one Comercial Mexicana, Mc Donald's and other small places to eat.'
