'Great hotel for families! What we love is that the poolarea's are seperate, so one for kids, and one further away for adults with a very relaxed atmosphere. no one is on top of each other. pools and poolarea's are great, lots of space everywhere set amids lush, exotic gardens. staff are very friendly and more relaxed I found compared to the neighbouring Son Vida hotel. They made lots of jokes with the kids, who ate free by the as we are SPG members. Special thanks to Miss Solise, who served us everyday at the exact right time by the pool, always pampering to the kids. bless her... rooms are a good size, we had a great view, on the topfloor. location is isolated but only 10 euro taxi fare one way, into to town or the beach; 25 to the airport one way. there is a freeshuttle bus to the son vida hotel. Food at the restaurant is casual , tasty and good value. Portions are very generous. starters are almost a full meal. We loved it here and will definately be back!'
