'We have just had a week in this hotel and could not find anything wrong. I would not do all inclusive (Plenty of Brits moaning about A I) because it is a waste of money and the drinks in the hotel are cheap enough anyway, it is also close the cafes and cheaper bars. The breakfast is oaky plenty of it too, but the evening meal is very basic, meat and two veg, if you are a picky eater this is the not the place for you. The rooms are tidy and maid service everyday plus clean towels too, and plenty of hot water. The only down side was you can smell smoking come from other room which is not nice and the entertainment is rubbish, oaky if you like ballroom dancing with the over 60+ Room Tip: Don`t listen to moaners, deside yourself!!
