'We stayed here for the past week and the hotel was good. The rooms were cleaned every day and the maid was very good, nothing was too much trouble. The buffet style food was ok, altough more of a slection for kids would have been nice, but you would not starve. We were All Inclusive and we had no problems. I have read reviews where people state the drinks were limited to one at a time, but everyone i seen, including ourselves, could get 2 or 3 drinks at a time no problems, and bar staff were friendly. All in all, we would return to this hotel'
