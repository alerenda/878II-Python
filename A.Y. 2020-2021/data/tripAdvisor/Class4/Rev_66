'I recently stayed in this hotel on my own. Even though the location is right next to the bus station and ferry terminal I felt the safety of the room was not good. There was no escape route in the event of a fire as my room looked out onto a brick wall with a huge drop down to ground level. Other than this, stay was pleasant enough.
