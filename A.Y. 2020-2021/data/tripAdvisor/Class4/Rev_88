'This is a wonderful place to stay if you like adult fun, the pools are topless and lots to see. They were very helpful with any issues we had and tried to make our stay the best it could be. We loved it and are looking forward to going back as soon as we can. The food is okay, lots of different choices. Room Tip: If you don't like your roo, have them take you to another one.
