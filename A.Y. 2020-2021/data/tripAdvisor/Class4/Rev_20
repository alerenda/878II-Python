'If you want a holiday with average accommodation, but wonderful customer service then this is the place to stay. I have stayed here twice now, once in July/August 2010 and again with 4 adult children in December. The staff are very friendly and cleaned the room every were very accommodating to our wishes. The cost of the accommodation is reasonable, beautiful views, nice swimming in the pool and beach. It is close to grandmother and grandfather rock. It is a little of the beaten track, but if you head to grandfather grandmother rock, there is a walkway from just before the shops down to the resort. The food they serve at the restaurant tastes nice, it has European and French, as well as Thai cuisine. So if you want a holiday with affordable accommodation with a homely feel, then this is the place to stay. We caught the sangthew (may have spelt that wrong) into Lamai Beach from the main road about 400 metres away. Also there are cheap places to buy breakfast and dinner on the main road.'
