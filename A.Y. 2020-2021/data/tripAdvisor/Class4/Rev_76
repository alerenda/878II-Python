'Arrived by car and parked in the P-basement. Cost €12 pr night but is worth it when looking at all the bumped cars parked in the streets:) The hotel was packed with pensionists that (i think) has arrived there by bus (many of them!). So this is no hotel for party, but for families and couples. The room - Nice practical interiors, but old. My bed has had a hard life prior my visit - it was very "wiggely"! :) The views from balcony was nice, we got a corner room (not in front line). We overlooked playa Levante. AC was very effective. No WiFi included but cost only €3 for 12 hours usage. Laundry service was super. Cleaning and ironing shirt cost €2,50! Like new when deliverd back to us:) Breakfast - one thing under average. Plain, dry bread and all industrial made food. Placing your food on trays made it feel like eating at a bad cafeteria rather than a 4* hotel! I feel sorry for those with full pension (all meals served at hotel). Pool area - nice and clean. Many sun beds and all day service from bar. One thing we reacted to was that you had to order from the bar, you could not bring your own mineral water. I understand when seated at tables, but when taning in the beds... Thought we had payed for free usage of the pool in the roomrate!!? Overall a great hotel with great location in Benidorm!'
