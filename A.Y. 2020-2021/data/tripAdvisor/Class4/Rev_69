'This was our second time at the Haksbill. I was slightly worried about returning because would it be as good as we remembered, but knew from before that many returned time and time again, which must mean something. We wanted a quiet 10 days to relax and destress and couldn't think of anywhere better to go. We were not disappointed in any way. The staff were lovely, many remembering us from 2 years ago! The rooms are clean and fresh, maybe not top hotel standard with tv etc but who cares, they are very comfortable and after all you are only going to be in the room to sleep and wash! Why would you want to be there when in such beautiful surroundings. We spent our time reading, swimming and snorkelling. The snorkelling off the 4 beaches is all interesting and slightly different and there was always something different to see each day. The food was wonderful, we have never eaten so much fish, but it was so good! A special mention of Mr Bakshi, the manager, who was always helpful and very interested in ensuring the guests were happy, of Sylvia, Millie and William, who were lovely. But particular mention of David, you are the man! and of Veronica who cooks the best omlettes in the world! They are 'cooked with love'. see you next year!!'
