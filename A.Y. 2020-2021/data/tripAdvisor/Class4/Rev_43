'Had to stay overnight and catch a plane out of Cancun, so I stayed at the courtyard. With the free shuttle to and from the airport, this hotel filled my needs. Less than ten minutes from the airport. The shuttle was there when I got out of customs. The grounds are nice but since I was there for one night, I didn't explore around the hotel. The room was good, nice and clean. The bed was great. The folks at the front desk were helpful even if I really didn't need their help. I ate at the restaurant which was good but a tad on the high side. I kind of expected that at the hotel. All in all, a good place to stay if you want close to the airport and staying short time. The beaches are a little far so if you are expecting a resort, this is not it.'
