'I have now stayed at this hotel several times on business. It is currently being refurbished which it needed and I have high hopes for it when it is completed. The location is good, the prices good for Aberdeen and the staff are very good. The food is better than you would expect and the rooms are fine for business travel. Don't expect luxury or anything fancy, just have a beer, a chat, some good food and an early night ready for a good breakfast and that first meeting of the day. I just like it, it has a nice little vibe. Room Tip: Call and discuss. See more room tips'
