'I can’t even remember how we got to the hotel’s website, but we were really lucky. We thought they have two hotels but is really the same one with different packages, they both have great prices, but book for the GRAND Viva Beach: for a few more dollars they will give you a better room, premium beverages and access to a Brazilian restaurant without a reservation. It is not a 5 stars hotel, but it is nice and clean and the hotel may not be huge, but they have all you need (two swimming pools, pool bar, gym, spa, business center, restaurants, snacks, some aquatic sports…). Did I mentioned it is close from the best clubs in Cancun, and that the hotel has this incredibly beautiful and calm beach (better than other hotels next to it). Bad things about this hotel... no waiters in the beach... the internet is not free, and not all the restaurants have AC.'
