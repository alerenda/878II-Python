'I went went 3, old and best girlfriends on this trip. The resort was nice and more quaint than other all-inclusives I had been to. The staff was lovely and the food was average, except for the sushi bar that was amazing! My main complaint is that all of the bars except the lobby bar closed by 7 PM. So, if you wanted to enjoy a drink outside, you had to go all the way inside to get your 8 oz margarita. However, I highly recommend the mango margarita. The entertainment group was not as lively as I have experienced by comparison at other all inclusives. For the price, you can stay at a much better place in Cancun with a wider variety of things to do. If you want peace and quiet and a beautiful beach, this is the spot for you.'
