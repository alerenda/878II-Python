'As I stated in my Mexico city review of the Hotel Riojas...this place is perfect for the non-preferential traveler...someone who just wants a centrally located, clean, safe, comfortable, and inexpensive place to stay - apart from the Hotel Zone - I am a Maya Archaeologist and have stayed here since 1993 and highly recommend it to those with similar attitudes. If you consider your hotel simply a safe and comfortable place to sleep with air conditioning and cable TV...this is it 4 U...why spend hundreds of dollars per night in the Hotel Zone, when you can just show up, sight unseen, and get a great room for tens of dollars on the hundred (compared to the Hotel Zone) and be centrally located in downtown Cancun, which is regularly serviced by a local bus to the beaches in the Hotel Zone every 15 minutes, as well as access to a supermarket, nightclubs, restaurants, etc., ....just pay your airfare and get a room once you arrive...you'll save hundreds of dollars and get just as nice a vacation However, if you are expecting Miami Beach in Mexico...this place IS NOT 4 U...spend the extra $500 bucks or more 4 the week and stay in the Hotel Zone...this place is for someone who understands commonplace comfort, affordability, locality, and desires more of a local experience. I absolutely LOVE it and would HIGHLY recommend it to any friend of mine...but the again...I am a archaeologist...lol! Room Tip: Great Place in Downtown Cancun! See more room tips'
