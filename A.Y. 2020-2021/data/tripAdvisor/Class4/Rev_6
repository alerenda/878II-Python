'Me and 4 friends stayed at the Girasol Condos for Spring Break March 12, 2011 for one week. We booked thru Student Breaks.-all inclusive package, which is definitely worth the cost for the extra money for VIP passes. Thank you student breaks, you were the cheapest and the easiest to work with. Girasol wasnt the most luxurious hotel but it was clean; just basic apartment, beds were kinda hard but we werent there to spend much time in our hotel room. The room was on the 1st floor and we had our own patio which walks right out onto the beach. The Girasol was within walking distance to EVERYTHING! We had a great time. Definitely a great place to stay for spring break. Cant wait to go back!!'
