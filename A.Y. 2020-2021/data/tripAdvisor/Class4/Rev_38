'The 1st room we checked into was typical Hostel type accommodation, quite basic standard, the we found out that the shower holder didn't stay up, so asked to change rooms. Cecilia on reception (even though spoke no English) was quite helpful and showed us a much better room for the same price. There's clearly two standards of rooms here, the newer rooms look like they've been build with the option of wheelchair access as are of a much better standard than the regular rooms. Breakfast was included in the price and we could order more or less anything they had. So we asked for toast, croissant, jam, coffee, orange juice and a ham and cheese toastie. It was all very nice although the service from Cecilia was a little on the slow side! I think she has just 1 speed which is perhaps 2nd gear, but still quite charming in her own way! Free wifi was a great added bonus.'
