'had family stay here during a visit. while the hotel itself is fine the beach is completely eroded and needs lots of work. asked around and found others in area have done beach rennovation that has yielded excellent results but the website does not reflect the loss of beach, they have sand bags piled up that you have to climb over to get to waters edge, beach bar could at anytime appears to go out to see with foundation exposed. they need to spend some $ to get the beach back up to OMNI standards.'
