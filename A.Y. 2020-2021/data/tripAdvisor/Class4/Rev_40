'I second what the others have said about the villas. They're fantastic value, comprising of kitchen (decent size), downstairs toliet and large lounge/dining area. This has patio doors which open on to the seaview terrace (which is a very good sizing hosuign 2 sun loungers, wooden table and chairs and BBQ). Upstairs is a bathroom, 1 twin room and 1 double room. We have 2 very young children and in our villa they were in the large twin with the balcony - which we kept locked at all times. Reception is small and friendly, the kids club is 10.30-12.30 (included in the price). Marta who runs this is great - she does colouring, play doh, takes them onto the tennis courts to play football, takes them to see the chickens, plays on the swings etc. If you wish to truly self cater I suggest you take the following with you - scouring pad, dishwasher tablets, dishcloth, salt, washing up liquid and tin foil (for some reason its very expensive in the Algarve!). Don't expect anything in the way of useful literature in your villa, so make sure you do your research on places to visit etc before you go. The villas are in 2 rows of 10. 1, 10, 11 and 20 end of row villas, so less overlooked and noise from your neighbours. Wouldn't hesitate in recommending these villas to anyone - just make sure you hire a car and remember Gale doesn't have a centre as such, just a very nice beach.'
