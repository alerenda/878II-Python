'Stayed at the Holiday Inn Aberdeen - Exhibition Centre for a conference and would recommend this hotel purely for the convenience of access to the Exhibition Center. The rooms are adequate but not exciting, and the restaurant food is fair, not exceptional. However if you are looking for luxury rooms and a culinary experience, this would not be a good choice. One thing that was annoying to us was that the breakfast was not included in our room rate - but there was no mention of this fact. Breakfast is simply an all-you-can eat buffet, which is usually indicative of "breakfast included" hotel. We were shocked upon checkout to note the rather expensive breakfast charges. Especially since we never signed a bill. Make sure you verify that breakfast is included before ordering.... Staff of the hotel were friendly but not particularly knowledgeable about the area - seemed many were from other countries.'
