'We came to Aberdeen by train, B & B was only £6 taxi ride away. Warm welcome was genuine. Room was at the back so was quiet. You got the Breakfast you ask for, Hot or cold. Could have others if ordered day before. Information was on hand if asked for. Would consider same venue if we are able to visit Aberdeen again. Room Tip: Quiet, warm, adequate for purpose.
