'I booked 3 rooms at this hotel months ago. We were travelling as a group, and none of us had ever been to Cancun before. We pretty much were just passing through, but we wanted a decent place to rest for a couple nights and have some time at the beach. I was a little nervous about booking a place that was so cheap, but I read through at least a hundred reviews, and I decided to go for it. It was a great decision! It's definitely not the right hotel if you are looking for luxury, but it was clean, comfortable, and a short walk to the beach. We had no problems at check-in, our reservation was right in the computer, and everything went smoothly. The breakfast that was included was great: choice of pancakes, quesadillas, or omelettes, a plate of fruit, and juice and coffee. The hotel is also close to a small shopping center where you can find food for decent price, if like us, you are looking to save money. The hotel met our needs perfectly, and I still can't believe how little we paid for it. We would definitely stay again!'
