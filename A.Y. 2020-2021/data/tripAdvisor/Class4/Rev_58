'We stayed here as part of a tour for 2 nights. We had a corner room with windows on one side and balcony on the other. Our room was small and the bathroom was very compact. The bed was also uncomfortable. The balcony with a very good view but there were a lot of insects crawling and mosquitoes as well. So do not leave your balcony door open at night . It was quite warm and the hotel does not have air conditioning, so we were tempted to leave the window open . On the positive side the breakfast was good and we had 2 dinners, which were also good. The view from the room was good and it is very close to the station and city center.'
