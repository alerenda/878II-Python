'The breakfast is included but they could change the quality and the amount of the food (corn flakes, coffe, bread and some fruits). The air condition in the room was terrible. It turned off every 10 minutes and it didnt start again. They tried to fix it and it was impossible. We asked to change our room the second night The mattress and the pillows were very bad.'
