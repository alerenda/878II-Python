'Check-in was quick and easy. We had a suite which was essentially two separate units with connecting doors, one having a kitchen and each having a bathroom. The suite was clean, in good condition and well appointed. The grounds were clean and well maintained. There were only four negative aspects about the Clipper Club. One was that the tap water was not drinkable and potable water was not provided. Upon realizing this, we went to the nearest store and purchased about a 2 liter bottle of pricey water for drinking an tooth-brushing. The next morning we drove to Cancun Centro to the Mega store and found 9 liter bottles for about $1.50US. We bought so many of these that we ended up giving some away on our last day. If a person did not have a car, they would have the choice of lugging heavy water bottles on the bus or spending a fortune on water nearby the Clipper Club. The only other complaints were the the area where you access the Clipper Club was torn up and not very attractive, the maids piled soiled linens outside our door each day, and the lady trying to sell time-shares was too aggressive. The Clipper Club is in a great location near most anything you woud want or need. The beach is nearby and you access it right by the lifeguard station. This is important since there are riptides which change constantly and the lifeguard makes sure you don't swim in unsafe water (a very important safety concern). We would stay at the Clipper Club again.'
