'We wanted a break from city life, and choose this place based on the trip advisor reviews. We had the white suite, as the gold was not available. It was lovely antique style and very large, although i found it a bit dark. The house and garden were spotless and tastefully decorated. The hosts, Olga and Kim, could not have been more accommodating. They really do provide an excellent service and nothing seemed too much. We stayed for the evening meal and it was one of the best fish dishes I have ever had. The main complaint we had was the music: while i do not mind new age music, it was much too loud and too continuos. We found it hard to take our needed siesta on arrival. it was playing right outside our room as well as outside in the garden. My partner and I both felt we could not tell them to turn is down - the hosts try so hard for things to be perfect - but it was really too much for us. The other little negative i have is that the breakfast was not included in the price, which i found a little strange as it is a b&b. Overall though, if you like b&b´s and the personal touch, then i fully recommend this place - try and get the golden suite though. Room Tip: The golden suite is best. See more room tips'
