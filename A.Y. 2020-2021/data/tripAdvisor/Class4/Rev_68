'very lovely property, welcoming, equipped kitchen, good rate (about $50), and 2 blocks to bus station. Stayed one night to go dancing in Cancun before going to Playa del Carmen. Only drawback was my room was up 2 floors and courtyard is very dim, stairs wet from rain + high heels = very dangerous! Nice roof deck, quiet, came with fruit, comfortable bed, a/c, what else do u need? Breakfast very tasty, a few bucks.'
