'We stayed here in July for a weekend stay-cation as we live in Dubai. I had read all the reviews and thought they were all very glowing about the service and friendly (go the extra mile) nature of the staff. We stayed in a junior suite, which had recently been refurbished and the room was very clean and large. However the lights had to all be on to get the bathroom lights to work... Strange. Made the relaxing bath a bit bright. The food in the White Orchid was fantastic, a very good Thai selection (the red curry duck is amazing). Would recommend it 100
