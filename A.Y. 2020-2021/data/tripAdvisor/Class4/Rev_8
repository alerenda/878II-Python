'i use to live in mexico cancun and i was wondering how was this hotel! Finally got vacation and ad stay there. Very nice location to walk distance to laundry, restaurant, farmacie, good food, golf etc. Staff is good when you tip good, free wifi in the room perfect for Iphone, Take the option to have american breakfast included! You can walk to the club ! Good for party or to relax with the clean pool ! i really like it but dont forget the hotel is really not expensive so you pay for what you have. If you want luxe is not your place!'
