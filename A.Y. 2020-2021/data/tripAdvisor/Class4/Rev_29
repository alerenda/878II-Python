'I have been in that hotel three times and would comeback every time. Ok well its not one of the most luxury hotel in cancun but do you need that? The most important point for me to come back everything year is that i've never felt more welcome or invited than there.the employees try to do their best every time.for me its more visiting friends than go to a hotel.if you want to feel personal and not like a number in I big hotel you are right. Ok maybe there are a few little things which could be better but thats are not big deals. you deserve what you pay for. Big thanks for kevin and his animation team that guys know how to take you out and to let you have fun:-D So see you next year at Imperial Las Perlas.'
