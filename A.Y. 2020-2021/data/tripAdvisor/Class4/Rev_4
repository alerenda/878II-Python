'Stayed here the first two weeks in September, on a bed and breakfast basis. The breakfast was a bit hit and miss especially the cooked breakfast. Sometimes it was luke warm. Had a room with inland view, found it nice and quiet. The room was of a good standard, cleaned everyday. The hotel decor and furniture was of a high standard. On arrival there was a plate of fruit and a bottle of red wine in the room. Some of the residents have been going back to the Miramare for 20 odd years. Pool area was always clean. Plently of sun beds. Bar staff were friendly. Some nice bars in the local area, try Seville , we used it most lunch times and for a couple of evening meals.'
