'This hotel was perfect for us! We spent 3 days of our honeymoon here. It is a great little hotel, perfectly located, with the best view and a great restaurant. Staff was friendly and helpful! We are already planning on returning next year =) A stunning view that will not break the bank!!!! Absolutely stunning!!!!'
