'My husband is working in Antigua and we first visited Hawksbill for the day, then for a night, then for two nights. Now he is on vacation, and this is our first choice for a totally relaxing getaway. We love the honeymoon cottages, with spectacular views and air conditioning. We appreciated the welcome with cool towels and cold champagne. Claudette arranged a special birthday surprise for my husband. David served us wonderful rum punch plus our favorite Merlot wine. We met another couple, living in Antigua for the past 25 years, who also chose Hawksbill for their vacation getaway. Eden Beach is our favorite - spectacular beach, quiet, and secluded. Amazing sunsets!'
