'Love IT ....we have stayed at this hotel about 4 times now! We have always found it to be very, very, friendly The food is good! .....for what you pay! We have met some great people here!! just a shame we didnt keep in touch. If your going for more than a week , it could be a bit boring as there is no entertainment, But everyone sits and chats at the bar and you make your own .'
