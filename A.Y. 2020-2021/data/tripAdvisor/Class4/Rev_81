'We stay at this hotel quite frequently and have always been impresed by the attitude of the staff; helpful knowledgeable and polite. The meals are good. The accommodation is starting to look its age and it could do with a refurbish but the weekend breaks are good value for money. Pity it doesn't have a swimming pool. Two draw backs were the noise from the fans outside our room and also an area that staff use for a cig break hence lots of noise from them.'
