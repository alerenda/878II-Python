'The hotell staff was friendly right from the start. We got a great room on the fourth floor with a balcony and a stunning view over florence. Its close to the central station and a 10 minute walk into the center of the city. The best thing with the hotel was the pool and the bar/restaurant on top of the buildning. The only negative thing we have to say about this nice hotel is that if you book your room via a travelagency you have to pay for using the internet. The hotel could also use some renovation. But overal it was a very nice stay at hotel Kraft. Room Tip: Try to get a room on the fourth floor with a balcony See more room tips'
