'We stayed at this hotel for our summer holidays and we were really satisfied with the hotel facilities, the view and the service, not to mention the location which was very convinient. We booked 4 rooms, two of them withlagoon view and the other two with ocean view and kitchen facilities. As we were a big group (15 pax), the rooms with kitchen were suitable enough to serve breakfast and some dinners, as it was easier to buy some groceries at the local super market (Chedrahui) and to cook simple things at the hotel. I was surprised with the quality and variety of kitchen equipment available (blender, electric heaer, bread toaster, frigde,coffee maker, complete set of dishes, glassware, kitchen gadgets, saucepans and pots and many other things). The view both to the ocean and to the lagoon was lovely and inspiring; the hotel has also access to the beach and beach towels can be provided at the front desk. The pool is also very good and is open from 9 am untill 8 pm. Another feature I truly appreciated was the location: Plaza Forum, Coco Bongo, Hard Rock and Dady'O night club are a couple of steps from the hotel! The price is reasonable and is very reccomendable to book early to get a good price.'
