'We came here last month and stayed one week with my friends and met a lot of cool people in this place. Lots of backpapers from over the world ! There's a jaccuzzi, two terraces where you can drink, eat and party, a fully equipped kitchen and two fridges to store and cook your own food ! Rooms and showers are clean ! Staff is really nice and helpful ! It's located in a safe place, 2 minutes from a supermarket, 2 minutes from the direct urban bus R1 to the beaches, 1 minutes from quesadillas and tacos stands ! We didn't tried the big hotels here, but this is certainly one the best choice (price/quality/services) for a lowbudget holidays in this area !'
