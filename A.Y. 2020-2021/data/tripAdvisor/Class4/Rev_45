'The Punta Cancun Condos are in a good location, near restaurants and shopping. You can take the bus just about anywhere in Cancun for $1.00 U.S. The grounds of the Punta Cancun condos are very well cared for and the staff in professional and very courteous. It felt secure and safe. Our condo showed some wear and tear, but who spends much time inside when you are in Cancun? The beach in front of these condos is fairly eroded and there isn't much space to lay in the sun or play games in the sand. The hotel beaches are far nicer, but that is to be expected. I recommend a day trip on the ferry over to Isla Mujeres. It is a quaint island with a lot of nice shops and bars near the beach. You can rent a golf cart and tour the whole island in a few hours (make sure you don't rent your cart on the ferry). We even took a bus trip down to Playa Del Carmen for the day and had a great time. These condos are a good choice for a group of friends who want reasonable accomodations in a central location.'
