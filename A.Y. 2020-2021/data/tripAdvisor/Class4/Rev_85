'We stayed in the 'Honeymoon Suite' even though we weren't on our honeymoon. We chose this suite because it was the only one with a private pool, available for the dates we wanted. What we loved: large spacious traditionally furnished villa with beautiful handmade Italian tiles throughout, adorable fully equipped kitchen, two bathrooms (no bath). The view from this suite was spectacular with a large private terrace and private pool (after walking up 140 stairs from street to reach the suite).There is also another approx 400 stairs from the street to the beach though you can avoid this by walking down the road which winds down to the beach. What we didn't like: Queen size bed and the pillows were hard and uncomfortable which was surprising considering the 5 star price we paid for this suite. High pitched continuous squeal from the pool motor we found annoying and detracted from the otherwise quiet location. We were told this was normal. From the day we were shown to our room to the day we left there was no contact from the staff and no room service and NO PHONE. We were told we had to use our mobile phones to organise our daily activities and bookings which is expensive when using international roaming. We were told to check out at 9am to enable the room to be cleaned for the following guests and our flight was at 430pm. We had to wait in the street as the staff had forgotten to organise our airport transfer even though they said they would book this on the day we arrived, Beautiful villa, loved Positano, unfortunately we found the service non existent, and to ask for assistance meant ringing the staff on your mobile phone. Even a note under the door form the staff would have been nice.'
