'We went here for the Easter long weekend. This is a great place for kids (we have kids aged 4 and 6). Lots of activities both inside and out and the entertainment for kids is great! Our boys would gladly return. The bike rental is def. a must as there are some lovely areas to bike outside the park. The price/quality of the restaurant is below average. We went to the food market and the pizza/pasta buffet. The food market was edible however the pizza/pasta buffet was not. We are not picky eaters but this was the worst meal we have ever had out. If you go here really recommend cooking. The grocery store is well stocked and has everything for a short stay. The cottages are comfortable but could use updating however it was clean and had what you needed.'
