'we stayed at the carisa's mezzanine and we loved it, we were right at the beach, 2 minutes from the best discotheques and in this mezzanine you have it all, 2 separated bedrooms with a small dining and living room, and you don't have to use the elevator. the best option for two couples or a small family. we will definitely going back!'
