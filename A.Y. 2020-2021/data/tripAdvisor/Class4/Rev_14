'We stayed family of four 9th-16th April. Apartment really big 3 bedrooms bathrooms could sleep 8 comfortably and washing machine on balcony at the back. Kitchen you could cook in easily big fridge we didn't use as all inclusive. The all inclusive hotel crystal park 2 minutes walk away food was good pleanty of choice and you could eat all day if you wanted we did breakfast and evening meal (we couldn't eat all day too full). Drinks were fine kids loved pool and 10 minutes walk to the beach. There was entertainment but we liked quieter bar children did go to kids club in evenings and met loads of people. Pool under cover which was great less sunburn we could use 3 hotels but found this was best glad in apartment as no noise hotel residents not so lucky. We will look to rebook.'
