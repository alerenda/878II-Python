'we arrived at the hotel on the 17th to 28th of may. The staff were very friendly on arrival and gave us a lovely room over looking the bay on the 7th floor. We would recommend this hotel because of the location. We had a great time and met some lovely people. We arrived home and have allready booked again for next may 2012. Hope to see all the lovely people we met next year.'
