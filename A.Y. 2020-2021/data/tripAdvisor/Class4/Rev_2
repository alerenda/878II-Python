'I stayed one night at the Bastion Hotel in March 2011. The guy at the reception was friendly when I checked in. He upgraded me to a better room category, which I thought would be a nice thing. When I opened my room on the 7th floor, I was a little surprised, because it had two single beds, instead of one double bed. This seemed to me a little strange for an upgrade room… It was situated towards the front of the hotel, but it seemed to be well isolated, as no noise could be heard. The room was sufficiently big, but if this was really an upgraded room, the standard rooms must be rather small. The decoration and furniture was everything else than stylish and seemed to be a little outdated. It was equipped with a small TV and a mini-bar. The wireless internet connection was available for free and was fast and working well. The bathroom was well sized, but a little outdated, too. Just the shower curtain seemed to be pretty new. The bathroom itself was very clean, as was the room. I went down at 9 AM to take breakfast, but there were just a few things left. The selection isn’t really impressive, though. I didn’t use the bar or the restaurant, but it didn’t look very inviting anyway. Hotel parking is free, but not secured. The hotel is located in an industrial area, very near to the A6 highway leading to Amsterdam. Almere city centre is 2-3 km away, Amsterdam city centre about 30 km, Schiphol airport about 40 km. Since the customer I had to visit was located very near to the hotel, it was a good choice for me. For other reasons than this, I wouldn’t really recommend it. I paid 88,50 € per night incl. breakfast, which I though was a little too much for an hotel of this quality in an industrial area.'
