'My husband and I chose this Villa after researching for a long time! We were not disappointed at all. From the moment we arrived until we left we had assistance from someone at the Villa for either luggage help, restaurant recommendations, travel arrangements to Pompei etc. The Villa sits up high which afforts a spectacular view on your (sort-of) private balcony. This was the only surprise based on the pictures. The balconies are only separated by plants and, therefore, not really private. We highly recommend this as a vacation choice for families or a special getaway for couples. Room Tip: We stayed in the Primavera Suite and thought it was lovely. See more room tips'
