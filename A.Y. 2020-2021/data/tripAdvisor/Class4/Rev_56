'We took this hotel as part of a package & found it very good value for money. It had been updated in 2005 & was very clean & modern. Our bedroom was a good size and nicely placed at the rear. The breakfast was adequate. The position of this hotel is excellent. It is very close to Wenceslas Square,the Metro & Tram, so getting about is no problem. The staff were very friendly & helpful and one recommended a restaurant to us on the first night which we enjoyed so much that we went there every evening. One review mentions the fact that the safety box in the bedroom was charged for. I don't know where these people have stayed before but, as frequent travellers, we are usually charged. All I can say is that the price at the Da Vinci was minimal (just over £1 per day). A nice change from the exhorbitant fees which some hotels charge. All in all, very good value. We would certainly use this hotel again. Pat. Darlington Room Tip: Rear is quieter. See more room tips'
