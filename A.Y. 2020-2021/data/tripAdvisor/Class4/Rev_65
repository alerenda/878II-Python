'The Don Miguel 2 is situated just up a slight incline from the back of Miguel 1,could not find the Advisor page for these apartments.We were in apartment F on the 21st floor owned by Michael Baker and refurbished to a good standard.Fantastic view over the whole of Benidorm (Not much to beat it) and about 4/5 minutes from the beach. Nightlife and Bars just far enough to not bother about,but close enough to walk without exsertion.'
