'My friend and I travelled to Cancun in March 2011, during the American springbreak. The hotel is very basic but nice. The breakfast area is absolutley lovely and the food is great. The staff are very friendly and the poolside is very lively and fun. There is a guy called Kevin Wald who is based at this hotel he provides you with all the information regarding nights out and offers fantastic deals including transportation. He really took care of us during our stay, he got us VIP tables at clubs with bottle service and also went to lengths to get us our favourite shots. People really exaggerate when they say that this hotel is very far from the club zone. You can hop on a bus fo next to nothing and will take you about 10 mins to get there or get a cab 5mins. Also this hotel is a short bus ride away from down town where we booked all our excursions for next to nothing and ate at lovely resturants which are very moderately priced. To all you party animals this is the hotel to stay out, its cheap and cheerful, good food, brilliant entertainment and because KEVIN WALD the party animal is based there. He really did make our stay even more enjoyable...we love you Kev!!'
