'This hotel was ok. We had stayed 2 nights there. The room is very large (we were sleeping 5 in it). There is a private balcony with a panoramic view on the beach and the ocean: amazing! The air conditioning was working well. The bathroom was large and clean. The toilet and the shower are in the same room. In another, there are the sink and the closet. The beds are really really REALLY strong. I had never slept before of a bed strong like this... but I had sleep well. The clean between the 1st and the 2nd day was very quick: new towels, that's it! There is wifi in the lobby only, but it is free. It is possible to have breakfast at the hotel for around 100 pesos (it is really nice breakfast!). There is a swimming pool. The water is not so clean, but it is nice to go in the swimming pool after the beach. The staff seems to be nice as well. Room Tip: Ask for a view on the oceanfront, it is the same price.
