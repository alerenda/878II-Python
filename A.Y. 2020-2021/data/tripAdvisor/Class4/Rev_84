'I didn't really get the "hostel" feeling from this place and I was so hoping to have it as a solo traveller. It's easy to get to from the airport (catch the shuttle to ADO bus terminal) and the area's lively. The breakfast shouldn't even be advertised or the jacuzzi. Breakfast was white bread (hello heart attack), jam and coffee. There's a sign that states only two slices per person. lol If you wanted to use the jacuzzi, it would've taken an hour to turn on and clear all the dust inside of it. The owner seemed miffed because I asked to see the dorm room before giving any cash. The staff didn't seem happy to work there or the owner which was a bummer. Okay if you're NOT a solo traveller and not expecting a hostel vibe. More like a seedy hotel. This review's a little late, but I decided to see if this hostel was listed. I went on to Tulum and had a much better time. FYI...You could feel the springs through the mattress, so bring a sleeping bag.'
