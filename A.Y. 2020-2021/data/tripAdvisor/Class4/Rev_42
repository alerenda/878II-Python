'I actually stayed at this property in May of 2007. The hostel is a modest place with basic amenities. The staff was helpful and friendly. The room was clean and we had a private bathroom. They served a continental breakfast in the morning for a quick start. We used it as a stop over on our way to Holbox Island. It is the centre of the market area where you can find great food and shopping. We plan on staying there again this year for another stop over.'
