'Stayed here for 2 nights and have to say was a bit sceptical at first as the building is round a corner and looks scruffy on the outside but what do you expect for £3 a night per person? The decor needs some tlc! The room had double bed with a fan and big fridge. Got given 3 keys for security for front door, hall door and room door which was good. Owner seems friendly but you can tell he is trying to save money with not many lights and basic amenities. However, clean bed and shower right next door and roof terrace to sit up on. Kitchen is also basic. Ideal for 2 nights. Good location for great food literally around the corner from food stalls! Would recommend if you are looking for cheap no frills clean and safe room in downtown cancun!'
