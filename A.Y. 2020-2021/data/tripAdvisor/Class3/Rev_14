'One of the cheapest rooms in Berlin - and you get, what you pay for - rooms are very simple, with walls covered with posters, quite clean bathrooms, but helpful stuff and the best breakfast we've eaten in Germany :) Great location and earplugs make it very good choise for a budget travellers. Room Tip: Reserve room that's not above the entrance. See more room tips'
