'Having just returned from a 4 day break in the lovely city of Prage the only thing that spoilt it for both of us was the hotel accommodation. The Da Vinci classifies itself as a 4 star hotel, we'd say more like 2! Our first impressions of our room were dark and dingy and in need of upgrade. The breakfast room, located in the basement, was very small and untidy, and the waiting staff dressed in casual attire which did not help towards giving the hotel a professional image. Breakfast was average and we had the same food stained sugar bowl on our table 2 days in a row. Our main concern however, and which led to us leaving the hotel for another one half way through our stay, was the dangerous shower in our room, one minute being stone cold, the next burning hot, not a pleasurable experience! Although offered another room by the staff we did not feel compelled to stay any longer. All in all very disappointing and, to say the least, misleading in it's description.'
