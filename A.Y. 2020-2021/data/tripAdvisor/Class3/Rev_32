'We had our first trip to Desire in July. The experience was wonderful...except for our room. They put us below the jacuzzi bar (and this supposedly was an "upgrade"). It was the worst part of the whole trip! We were woken up every morning at 7am due to the staff cleaning the bar above us. After staying up all night, it was NOT fun. Also, an electric saw was being used at 2AM on our last night. I suppose the staff has to work at night, but it was very rude to have a saw going. I would love to return, but will specifically ask NOT to be place in building 10!'
