'Having stayed at majextic in Punta Cana, ands various other decent hotels. I would honestly say this was one of the MOST mediocre places, dolled up to seem like a quality hotel and hyped to the max. The food goes through you in 90 mins. The service is staged and the conversation is scripted, the restaurants are empty but you'll still have to queue as the staff either can't or WON'T manage and you really DO have to get up at 5 to reserve a sunbed. Honest no kidding!!! Beautifull place, rooms OK and room service adequate at best. If your spending £8-9-10K GBP for a a family then be prepared for short change. Aqua nautus was excellent from the 2 dutch guys, apart from that seeing a LIVE crab killed with a cusion by a young american girl whilst at dinner was a bit of a shock in the restaurant as her parents just looked on but thats the US for you !!! Maybe its me!!!!'
