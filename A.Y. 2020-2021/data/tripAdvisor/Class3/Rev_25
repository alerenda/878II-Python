'rooms OK a bit basic . great location views fantastic , staff friendly and helpful , food in the hotel ( not good If you eat in the resident restaurant . If you wont to eat out on the lovely decking you have to pay, food very good it seems that it comes from too kitchens If I went back I would go B&B their are lots off places to have a good meal and at all prices. Melcesine for use was the best location on the lake we had a fabulous 7 days could have stayed longer if we have the chance would go back and stay at this good but basic hotel for it great location but only B&B Room Tip: had a side view ok See more room tips'
