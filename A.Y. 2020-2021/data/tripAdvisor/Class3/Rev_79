'oh my goodness, what to say, not the sort to usually write negative reviews but really felt I had to say something. a beautiful apartment with everything in place for a good experience. let down completely by appalling management which messed around guests, double booked and suggested sharing sofa beds with total strangers for a 'discounted rate' as a solution to their double booking. This all in addition to hostel staff who burst into the room between 1am-3am every night without fail to either wake everyone up, ruin the pre-drinking vibes or argue appallingly with guests they had messed over with various levels of double booking. I have honestly never heard or witnessed a worse example of customer care then this and was pretty shocked at the unprovoked abuse being thrown at a lone American traveller 'are you American? because you Americans think the world owes you something, you should be grateful you have a roof over your head' this is all after they had messed up her stay with a double booking. all in all, pretty shocked. perhaps if there hadn't been so much drama in my room at this time the stay would have been more positive. I would recommend this as a good party hostel where you enjoy surreal experiences but don't expect any professionalism from the staff.'
