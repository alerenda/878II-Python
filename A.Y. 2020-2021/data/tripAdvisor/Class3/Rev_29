'The hotel is up a really steep hill and quite a walk from the centre of Palma. The hotel reception is nice and modern and check in was easy. The rooms and bathroom are very modern but stank of smoke. There was a view out onto the road looking down towards the ocean. The road got busy as it was on a turn for local buses and coaches. I liked the area where the hotel is. I would recommend this hotel and would stay again.'
