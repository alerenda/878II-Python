'Although the hotel is central, I'm sure we wouldn't choose to go there again. It's advertised as a four star, yet it is obvious it has lost it's 4th star somewhere in the last decade if not before. The room size was good, terrible room service, no minibar (just a locked fridge), sea view that is overlooking the parking lot. Pool was okish but even the rude staff at the pool restaurant would lock everything and leave early in the afternoon well before the sun goes down. My advise is to just avoid. It's overpriced for what it is.'
