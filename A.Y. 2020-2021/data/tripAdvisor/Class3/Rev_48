'First can I say what a great building good rooms great pool after that its time to dig the travel books out and head to Turkey ! Staff are okay though i would question there poor attitude towards the english the food at best can be described as bad buffet leftovers. Having read the reviews it is a concern they seem to be overly positive feedback after very negative comments, but im sure the Deloix would not post their own comments would they !! Overall kids liked it we ate out all the time and foe my family its Turkey next time !!'
