'We spent 2 nights in this hotel. The double room is of a good size, with a double wardrobe and quite a lot of space on the floor, that we could place an inflatable bed for our child to sleep on. The bathroom was quite clean (could have been a bit better) but ridiculously small...in order to be able to dry yourself up after the shower, you needed to open the bathroom door...:-) All in all, very good value for price, and in a very good location. Room Tip: Room 5 on second floor was the one we were allocated and was good. See more room tips'
