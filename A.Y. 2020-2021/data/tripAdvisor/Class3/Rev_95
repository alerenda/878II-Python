'We booked a room in this hotel, a "bay view" room. First of all, a couple of things that's not the hotel's fault: not a good location, at least 10 minutes walk away from a couple of restaurants, and a 10 minute bus's ride away from the real hotel zone and beaches. Second of all, this part of the lagoon smells BAD. It smells like something is rotting. That's what you get in the "bay view" room. My family was looking for a budget stay since we would be taking a lot of tours all day, didn't need a resort. However, this place was just terrible. The AC is super loud and has no remote. If in the middle of the night you felt too hot or cold, you'd have to get up. For someone short like me, I'd have to climb onto a chair to adjust the settings. They have a fridge and sink section that has so much rust that no one would ever want to use it. The shower had no pressure and was cold for most of our stay. It may be okay since this hotel is cheap; however, after two nights, the front desk guy said that they only charged us for 2 people's stay, and that since we're a family of 4 with two adults and two kids, we would have to pay 1600 pesos more. (150 USD) This was at the end of a very long day; without access to phone and internet to check what was going on, we didn't want to be kicked out. So we talked to him and he agreed to let us pay only an additional 1000 pesos, IF we pay in cash. SOOOO SHADY. I've posted some pictures of this place -- if I had seen this pictures before on tripadvisor, I would've never booked this hotel.'
