'we rented from michelle and peter hermick. there were some good and bad. first the good the ocean view from our balcony was great, the roof top view of the bay was also very good. great place to go and sun but there was just one lounger. the rooftop shower was neat. now the bad, the price that was emailed to us changed when we arrived, we rented 2 rooms 1 ocean side and one bay side, the ocean side was called a penthouse it was clean but far from a penthouse, i would rate 2 star, the sliding door was so noisy at night when there was wind it sounded like a train. cable tv had 4 channels internet worked in the so called penthouse but did not work bay side even though we were told it would. the bay side room had a kicthenet but no dishes, the small ice box in the room was very noisy, it sounded like an air compressor when it run. the couple who traveled with us had problems getting fresh towels, there was even a letter left in your room telling you to turn of the air conditioner when you were out of your room. there are a lot of nice places to stay in cancun don't spend your hard earned money renting from michelle and peter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
