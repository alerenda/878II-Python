'Actually below average. If you want a truly old school Mexican experience, stay here. As you enter, it's like stepping into a set for an old Mexican black and white movie from the '60s. The employees are nice, but don't expect too much in the way of accommodations other than simple and basic. It is air conditioned (wall unit) and good for one night. There is a restaurant, bar and pool here. Yaxchilan Avenue is also filled with restaurants. The Ramada, more expensive, is a few doors down.'
