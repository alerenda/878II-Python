'Stayed at the Sotavento for 3 nights - had stop overs on either end of a trip to Cuba. Best price in the area, and the staff is friendly and accomodating. It's on the lagoon side of the hotel zone, which I loved. I'm not keen on the resort culture of Cancun, and this was the best place for me. Pros: Close to the airport, the garden is beautiful, nice pool area with plenty of shade, decent restaurant, gorgeous grounds, close enough to walk to the beaches. The second room we stayed in was newer. Quite nice. Cons: The bathroom in the first room I stayed in had an unpleasant odor. We eventually figured out to use the shower drain cover and it helped. I suspect the second room i stayed in had bed bugs. I saw a lot of workers carrying matresses around, so this was probably the case. looks like the hotel is taking care of it by throwing all the matresses away. It's definetly a 3 star hotel in Mexico - but I would stay there again.'
