'This was our family's first beach vacation - didn't know what to expect and didn't want to break the bank and wanted the freedom so I looked for an independently owned condo. Our family consists of husband, wife and three early twenties kidsI Villa Marlin had good reviews - I corresponded via phone with Al; but it sounded too-good-to-be-true. There was no money down so we had nothing to lose! We were more than pleasantly surprised at the hospitality of Al and Fernando, the hosts of the unit. They offered info about the area, personally checked on us and answered any and all of our questions! It was a great location and worked perfectly for us. It's not the Hilton but neither was the price! My only gripe was that we weren't warned about the airport and how they con you into checking out time shares! It was a fantastic experience and we will be back at Villa Marlin.'
