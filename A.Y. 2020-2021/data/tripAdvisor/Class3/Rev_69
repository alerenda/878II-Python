'this smaller hotel is pretty close to some of the big resorts but, this is a very modest place. on this trip, i just wanted to hang out at the beach and see the ruins in chichen itza. the hotel is not a big mega resort and doesn't have it's own beach like a lot of the places down there, but there is a public beach(playa tortugas about 15 minute walk from the hotel). you can always go to the other beaches at resorts if you like...it's not like anybody really cares or will know(unless you act like you don't belong there). there are a few places around the corner from the hotel...some small places to eat that are open early, a place to do laundry, a farmacia(grocery store), a sushi place. you can walk about 10 minutes and get to several other places...or take a taxi...whatever you are into. the hotel has a very small pool and a little outside cabana type place to eat. i didn't try it, but it seemed ok. my room had a comfortable king size bed, an old tv that worked and clean towels in the bathroom. in all i would say...go ahead and stay here if you can get a good deal around $30 US a night or less..but, if you are looking for a luxury experience...you may want to shop around somewhere else. also, the guy at the front desk was very helpful and laidback.'
