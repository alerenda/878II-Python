'The hotel is in a great location. Within walking distance to the train station, Odenplan and even Gamla Stan. The room was OK but there was a damp, musty smell from the bathroom (we got used to it, though). It's a must to have a private bathroom, not one of the common bathrooms. The breakfast was below average (limited selection) and the front desk staff was not particularly helpful. Next time I visit Stockholm, I would first look for a different hotel in the same area.'
