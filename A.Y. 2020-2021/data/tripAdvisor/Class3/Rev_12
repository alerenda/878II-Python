'As we were only passing through Cancun we only really needed a basic place to sleep for the night and Sotavento ticked this box. It is not a fancy hotel, the room we stayed in was a very basic white room, there were no paintings or colors in site. The air conditioner worked well which is always a plus when you are trying to sleep through a hot Mexican night. As we arrived to Cancun late we did not want to roam the streets late at night, so we dined at the hotel restaurant which was basic but satisfactory. Breakfast was included when we booked our room but it was nothing special, toast, juice, coffee, tea and cereal if you want a hot breakfast you will need to pay extra for it. Overall if you are just passing through Cancun and need a place to stay that won't cost you a fortune than this place should suffice.'
