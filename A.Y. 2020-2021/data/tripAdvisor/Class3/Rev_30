'Stayed here during a family trip to Paris as part of a backpacking trip through France and Italy. The hotel is easy to find, close to the Metro, and it a good area for simple dinning, supermarkets, and shopping for eassentials. The wireless service worked well. The rooms are spartan and simple, but comfortable. If you are looking for the sort of room you can lounge in for hours, this ain't it. But if you just need a place to sleep and bathe while you are out making the most of your time in Paris, this is a good option. Staff is very helpful, with excellent English. If you are more than two people, pass on the breakfast and just buy your own provissions at anyone of the markets in the neighborhood (3 at my count).'
