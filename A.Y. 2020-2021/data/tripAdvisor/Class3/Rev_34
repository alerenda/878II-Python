'We stayed here because of the amusing name, and because the price was right. It was one of the cheaper places we could find and book through Hotels.com. We were only in Cancun for one night, after flying in and taking a bus out to Holbox the next day. It's not the closest to the bus station, but is right next to a grocery store where we could stock up on some things easily. The room was simple and standard. Loud a/c and tile floors. But I slept okay, with no concern about drunkenanis. Breakfast was included, and was nothing more than bread and coffee. For an additional $5 US you can get hot foods like eggs and some other things.'
