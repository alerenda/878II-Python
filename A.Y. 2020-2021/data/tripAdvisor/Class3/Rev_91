'Other than location this hotel has very little going for it , It is a has been,4 star hotel,our visit was over the Xmas period , and there was no Christmas spirit at all, no entertainment and very little effort at Xmas decoration. The food was very ordinary, I have had better 10euro Spanish menus,The parking is expensive,The corridors to rooms are dismal, and the two lifts are slow and not up to the job when the hotel is full.We left a day early as we both had a bad case of the Montazumas..'
