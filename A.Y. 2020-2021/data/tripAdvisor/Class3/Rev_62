'The location of the hotel as mentioned is good and quiet, my wife and I found it just a little too far from the `old town` as we used to walk it quite often, somewhere just a little nearer would have been better. The hotel is mainly for the spanish people and we found the food not to our taste at all, hardly any selection and everything was always cold, I complained on both the first and second night ( it`s no good complaining when you are home) at the quality of the food on offer, some of the choices looked like they were for the dog, just bones and fat. There was bacon in the morning and eggs but again it was always cold. Apart from fruit, there was only a choice of 4 or 5 tired looking cakes and it was the same every night. I have a wide range of food taste and will try anything but this was one hotel I would not go back too. The room was comfortable and bathroom well set - out, if you want to give it a try please go bed and breakfast or room only. Room Tip: pay extra for a sea veiw. See more room tips'
