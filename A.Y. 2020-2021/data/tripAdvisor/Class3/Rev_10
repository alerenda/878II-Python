'My husband and I have just returned from a 4 night stay, we usually stay here once a year although last year we tried somewhere different. Check in was quick, friendly and efficient. Our room wasn't ready but they found us an alternative that was. We have stayed in one of the suites, executive and also classic rooms. This time we had a classic. It was clean and tidy and had everything we needed. We did however feel that the room wasn't actually cleaned during our stay, just had the bed made. We had breakfast in our room on two mornings which arrived on time & hot. One evening we had room service which again was on time, hot and very tasty. We are glad to hear that the menu in the Brasserie will be changing as we ate in here one night and it was only average but not cheap. We decided not to eat in the main resturarnt this time as it seemed at lot more expensive than on previous occasions & the menus did not tempt us. We also had afternoon tea which was excellent apart from the service! After sitting down at a table and asking if we could take a table by the window that had been vacated we were told "it's reserved", "did you book a table for afternoon tea" after sinking in our seats and feeling bad we thought lets leave it and with that he came back and said "you'll have to wait for us to make up the table - we are very busy". We didn't let the rudeness spoil our afternoon and like I say, the food was fab. One of the biggest problems was at night - the room got so hot and being on the ground floor we didn't want to sleep with the windows open. This did disturb our sleep every night which was a shame. I reported it to staff on check out and they just looked as if that was a normal complaint! The location of this hotel is excellent and the grounds are beautiful. All in all we had a lovely week but not perfect however, we will return i'm sure.'
