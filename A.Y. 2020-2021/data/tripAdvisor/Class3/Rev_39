'Was a bit nervous booking this place as it was one of the cheaper places I could find, but it turned out to be a nice little place. Our room wasnt the hilton or anything, a bit grubby but it was clean and safe! Did notice that other rooms were a bit nicer but they probably cost more. We didnt spend much time in the room so we didnt even notice. They staff was very friendly! The only bad thing I can mention is they have the worlds smallest elevator that only fits 2 people, and there was 3 of us, but we managed! Room Tip: Cheapest room, a tad grubby, nicer rooms, a lil more expensive See more room tips'
