'two friends and I booked this hotel due to it's location for a weekend trip to Paris. It was relatively cheap for the area it was in and we chose it so that we didn't have to travel far to get into centre of Paris. In fact you don't need to use public transport at all, everything is walkable from the hotel. However the alleyway in which the hotel is situated is horrid. It had a homeless man sleeping under one of the arches and some distinctly dodgy characters hanging around early evening and late night when we returned. The hotel itself was undergoing renovation so there were workmen who started work very early in the morning. There had been no warning of this when we booked. When we arrived, the hotel had only a record of one room booking when we had in fact booked and paid for two rooms. They tried to squash three of us into one room which we refused as we'd booked two rooms for a reason. Eventually, after much angst, they found us two rooms. However the man on reception was very rude and impatient with us (but then we were in Paris). The rooms are clean and a good size but it was a very hot and noisy hotel. I wouldn't stay here again and I wouldn't advise anyone to stay here.'
