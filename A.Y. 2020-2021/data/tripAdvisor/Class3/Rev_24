'I stayed here at The Hipotel -Eden Hotel for 4 nights with a four year old and three other adults and found it to not be as bad as people in other reviews had said. It now has new management, works are going on to fix the place up and has showers in all of the rooms. The people running the Place were nice and helped us alot. There were cleaners cleaning the rooms every day and they gave you a new towel and made the beds everyday, Lots of hot water. ok place to stay for the value.'
