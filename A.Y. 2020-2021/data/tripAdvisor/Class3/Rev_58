'When you go to AVA hotel in Helsinki don't expect anything fancy. It's quite basic hotel with small but quite clean rooms. The architecture and decoration in the hotel is simple and it looks a bit like an asylum inside. It doesn't have a 24h reception and if you check in during the night hours you have to contact the reception on how to enter your room. The personnel is speaking perfect English and they are quite helpful. It's quite far to walk downtown but it's near a big avenue were you can find a tram and bus station 50-60m from the hotel, were the 615 buses take you directly to the airport of Helsinki and you can use the trams to go to the city center. Nearby is also some small supermarkets, a pharmacy and a couple of restaurants but the area is basically residential. So if you don't care about fancy things during your stay, AVA can provide a clean, basic acommodation in a very good price.'
