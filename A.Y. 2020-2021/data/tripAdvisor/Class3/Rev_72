'hmm well i payed a lil bit more and got the private room... and it was pretty dam lousy, very poor qualityand ha the bed didnt have a sheet on it, and i had to walk to the front desk to get someone to come with the one and only air cond remote to turn on my ac.... every 4 hours. staff didnt really care and was a great hassle to get them off their office seat. it has a giant glass roof, which looks kinda cool but reallisticly it acts like a massive greenhouse. sure its the cheapest place in the hotel zone and it is fairly central, but for an extra 50
