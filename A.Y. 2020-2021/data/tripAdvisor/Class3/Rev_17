'Proprietor/hostess was charming and the vintage property and grounds were beautiful, but it is puzzling that the price for both rooms is the same when they are not in the least comparable. Tudor was comfy but Chateau was tacky, bathroom was not adequate and shower was so narrow that if you dropped your soap it was not possible to bend over to pick it up! Also annoying that the breakfast at a "bed and breakfast" is an extra charge and didn't seem to be very available. Room Tip: Tudor room with two queen beds is the best. See more room tips'
