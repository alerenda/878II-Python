'we have just returned from a 10 nights stay at the sealight, we also stayed last year & i have to say we were totally un-impressed the food was awful even worse than last year. its fine if you like eating stew or turkey. last year we were impressed by the fancy entrance & nice room but when you look past it, this hotel is 3 star & basic ! Beds were rock hard ! entertainment was well hmm non existant or total rubbish. the pool was freezing & dirty at the bottom. the staff were a mixed bunch some overly helpful & others dam right rude. yes there was no shortage of food & drink but all cheap alcohol & poor quality luke warm food ! we had 3 days of thunder storms & heavy rain everywhere leaked & the hotel put on no effort to put on any entertainment. there were children running back & forth the lobby & main bar area screaming with bordom. finally the hotel provided a few worn out packs of cards, scrabble & a chess board !!!!
