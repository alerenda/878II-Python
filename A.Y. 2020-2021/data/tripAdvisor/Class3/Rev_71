'I have chosen this hotel as it was having fair prices compared to other hotels having all inclusive option. This type of holiday is not my priority but having parents along with me, this option fit the bill. Hotel was clean and we got almost everything we are promised. They have cleaned the room every day but I had to warn them several times as the cleaning was not up to standarts. Some staff are really not professional enough so we had few upsetting moments. But overall, the service was good and fast. The staff were mostly friendly. I found a great opportunity to practice Yoga everyday with dear Anastasiya and learnt from her a lot! She is one of the nicest staff in the entertainment team. Special thanks to her :-)'
