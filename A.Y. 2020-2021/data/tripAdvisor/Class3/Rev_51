'I've stayed at the Ka'beh hostel for about 5 days. It's located in a quiet neighbourhood, close enough to some bars and busstation (which brings you easily to the zona hotelleres). The hostel is rather small, but there are two very nice dorms. The bathrooms are comfy and the kitchen is more than usefull. The info, service and possibilities at the hostel are great. Never a problem to have a party or play beerpong.'
