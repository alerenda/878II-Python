'I have been in this hotel several times during my Helsinki visits.It´s between center of Helsinki railwail station and intrernational airport Helsinki-Vantaa.Let´s say it´s from 12minutes to the main railway station and the 12minutes to the airport Helsinki-Vantaa.100meters from the hotel you´ll found street called Hameentie where´s few tram connections and many bus connections to the centre and to out of the centre of the city.You´ll found also bus stop to the airport- which means you don´t need to take expensive taxies to go to airport.Bus region ticket costed 4€/one way and was quarenteed for 90minutes(!).Someones of Ava´s rooms has fridge on their rooms and you´ll can buy some food,drinks from the local supermarkets which are open from 7a.m. ´til 11p.m. from Monday to Saturday and on Sundays from 12 a.m. ´til 9p.m...The rooms are clean,there´s possibillities to go for sauna too.The views for countryside are lovely with its small cabins.silence Side of the city.I guess this hotel is pretty famous and that´s why it´s many times reserved.I will return!.Thank you Ava hotel staff for your help and professional reception ladies on the desk.'
