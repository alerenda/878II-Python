'I stayed at this hostel for around a week, and the two men who worked at the front desk were wonderful. However thats as far as the good service here goes. Both the women that worked there were not helpful in any regard. They kept changing the amount of my room rate, (essentially stealing my money) regardless of pesos, or dollars. The kitchen was alright, not overly clean and worst off MY CELL PHONE WAS STOLEN BY THE STAFF. how do i know this? i was staying in their four bed dorm for females only, and i was the only person in that room. I locked the front door to the room, left my phone under my pillow with the alarm set (intending to take a nap after my shower) having spent a long day on the beach i went into the bathroom to shower and also locked that door. well somewhere in the 20 mins. i was in the shower the receptionist came in and took my phone. to top it off when i got the police involved she played it all off as if i was some drunk tourist who was out every night untill 5am, saying she had video, etc. and the matter was looked into and she was found to be lying. however the police could not do anything as they dont have cameras in the rooms themselves. so my advice to everyone DONT STAY HERE. Some rooms have bathrooms, some rooms dont, this place is very iffy, and i would never stay there again. The location to ADO bus station is a def. bonus to this hostel but there are many others in the same area, if someone were to stay here i would recommend a private room where you hold the only key. case closed. hope this is helpful and informative. Room Tip: Just dont stay here. The ONLY bonus to this hostel is the pool, and there are other hostels in Cancu... See more room tips'
