'My husband was so amazed when he found that this hotel is right next to JR Fukui station. We were there almost 7PM , so exhausted from traveling all day. We were informed that the hotel also offered Karei(Curry) rice for dinner. My children were so happy. The service here is very good , they are ready to help you. The room, like many hotel in Japan, small but provides everything even pajamas! The strong points for Toyoko inn group hotel are that they provide breakfast and let the children stay with you for free. But for Fukui branch, they also offer dinner too! Room Tip: Check the rates from the hotel chain web site . See more room tips'
