'We stayed in a double room 203 for 4 nights. Bathroom smelled badly at all times so we had to keep the door closed. The room was tiny, but the beds were comfortable. And it was quiet at nights unless a group of Italian students checked in to the room next door. The room has never been cleaned in a proper way. Towels were never changed even though we complained. I would not recommend to stay there for more than one day.'
