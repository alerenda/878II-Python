'The beach and adult pool is nice but kids play in the adult pool. The bars close early. The food is tolerable. Buffet rest. is good for bfast. The nicer restaurant has limited menu that gets old if you are staying more than 4 days. There is no room service. Whatever is listed on menu is not usually what you are getting. The wait staff are excellent though. The rooms are clean but you get 2 double beds, no frig, lighting is horrible and 1 outlet by the sink, no iron and no view. We were supposed to get a balcony w beach/pool view. We looked at the other building. The only rooms with 1 bed, frig and view/balcony are the presidential suites. Definitely don't go through Royal Holiday...if you do and incur problems, they are the only ones that can help you. The resort can't help you with anything. They didn't pick us up from the airport. They told us they would reimburse us for our taxi $71 but they never did. RH does as little as possible for you. We got stuck in a hurricane and our flight was cancelled. We knew 2 days in advance and tried to extend our stay. The hotel could not extend us. RH gave us the run around and in the end, we had to go to another resort. We ended up having to stay in cancun for 2 extra days and RH was ok with us not having a room. Tatiana and Sandra are especially awful. Since there i snothing else to do at night, you get to meet people at the lobby bar. We normally stay at Great Parnusses but wanted to try something different and closer to downtown. Park Royal was not a good choice. Everyone we spoke to that went through Royal Holiday - members included - did not receive transportation to or from the hotel, they were given rooms without the balcony after promised one by RH. It was disappointing. Room Tip: Buy the airport transfer directly with the airport taxi service if you can. If you buy the shuttle... See more room tips'
