'This was our first trip to Desire and prior to going we did a fairly extensive amount of research on the resort forums, and even engaged via email some repeaters with any questions that arose. It was even better than expected! What an amazing time. While the rooms are a little aged and could be updated a tad, the resort atmosphere was super comfortable no matter if you intend to go just for clothing optional, to relax, to party or to play. There was no pressure to partake in anything outside your comfort zone and everyone was extremely respectful of 'limits'. The grounds were small, which made it quick to get from one place to another. The beach wasn't the greatest we'd ever been to, however I don't know anyone who'd attend this resort for the beach. The food was outstanding! Could eat at all hours of the day, including up to 6am pizza at the bar after a late night doing... well... y'know. I believe alot of people are looking for a review of the night antics, and I'll keep it short by saying - if you want to, do it, others are... this is the place to live out fantasies! We will definitely be returning and couldn't be more thankful of the service and good times that the resort staff gave us. Special calls out to the entertainment staff - the water polo game comments will remain dear to my heart for a long, long time... :)'
