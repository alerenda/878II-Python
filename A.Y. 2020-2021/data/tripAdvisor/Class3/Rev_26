'It's fair value for money. What I have expected, is what I get. Nothing more, nothing less. Clean room, minimalisticly equipped, yet, providing all the confort you need for five day trip in Paris. Ask for the street side, backyard side provide a bit . Metro station is near by, several cafees,and stores are also there. Summary: for that kind of money (price of two dinner), you receive correct service.'
