'I see a lot of the recent reviews, and recognised some of the stories about the “quirks” we had also experienced. I have travelled to Paris before, and know the challenge of finding decent accommodation for a reasonable price. Residence Pelican was OK, but I would look elsewhere if I was returning to Paris. Having said that the family and I were not upset at all by the experience, and had a good stay. Is the location good? Yes, it was great. The family and I (wife, kids 12 and 9) did not experience any issues with the location – in fact it was really convenient. There was a good patisserie around the corner, good restaurants in the block, franprix supermarket a block away, and close to the Louvre. What is the apartment like? We had the penthouse, and it was quirky. It had lots of space. I reckon that “Fred” and associates don’t really invest in maintenance – the upstairs door onto the patio would not close, and I could see why, but this required some maintenance work. It was up 102 stairs, but we were assisted on arrival and departure to get our bags up and down. Like others, we had similar issues with lack of towels, little toilet paper, no toiletries etc. We visited the local supermarket to acquire items, and did get more towels from Fred. I note the comments on the washing machine / dryer by others – we did not attempt to use ours. But are the beds comfortable? Fine. The second bedroom only had a double bed, which the kids had to share and the room was small, but that was fine. Were the appliances ok? Fine. The kitchen was well equipped and worked. Was there wifi? Yes. Was it quiet? No. Like lots of Paris, the street is noisy, so bring ear plugs! Anything special? Fred booked us a taxi when we left, which all worked exactly as requested. Room Tip: We had the penthouse - get as high as you can. See more room tips'
