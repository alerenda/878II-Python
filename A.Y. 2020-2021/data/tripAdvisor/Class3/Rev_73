'With all but one thing considered, this was the best place I've ever stayed, and can't recommend it enough. However, the one thing is that it's awful. Awful. I stayed here on a stag do, so not my choice of accommodation. Some people actually choose to stay here. The rooms are like prison cells from the 1980's. If you are a student, back packing across Europe, then this may be ideal for you in terms of cheapness and for making new pretend friends. If you are a normal person, stay anywhere but here.'
