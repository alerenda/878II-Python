'this hotel is very average. Drinks at the bar were not very good, skip the mojito, threw it out after a few sips and it cost $6.This hotel is not close to anything. 20 min walk to the beach. The staff were so amazing though. So friendly and warm. Take mosquito repellent because they get into the rooms and in the pool at night. To be honest i was not a fan of cancun at all, it felt like i was in America. It lacks a lot of mexican culture. Advice, skip Cancun, hire a car and drive to Playa Del Carmen and down the south coast of Mexico. Cancun is very over priced.'
