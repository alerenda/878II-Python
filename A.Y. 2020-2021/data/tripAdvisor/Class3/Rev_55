'Stayed here twice in the past few years & I found the hotel to be very good. location was perfect with just a short distance to "where it's all happening @". Staff were the best I've ever had @ any hotel, so friendly! Food was ok for a 3* with a good choice everyday:) entertainment was a no no but who wants to stay in @ night in Cancun? Come on people!! All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to visit Cancun & not pay over the odds for a good hotel.'
