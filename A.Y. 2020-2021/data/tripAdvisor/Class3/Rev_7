'OPEN LETTER TO ALL THOSE COMPLAINING ABOUT CANCUN PLAZA CONDOS! I just had to respond to many of these bad reviews. None of you seem to complain about the phenomenal views each of these units have, nor do you complain about the beautiful pool and beach. You are complaining about the crummy room you were staying in. What do you expect when you rent from owners and managers who are less than reputable and just want your $40 per night and nothing else. A beautiful, clean and updated condo would not rent for $40 per night. Forty dollars would barely cover electricity charges for the a/c you will be using. Take note: If a manager is willing to give you a one week rental for less than $60 per night (low season) and $100 per night (high season)...BEWARE. Nobody with a nice, well equipped condo unit would be willing to rent for less. Many of the Cancun Plaza Condos are absolutely beautifully and CLEAN. You just won't get any of those for $35 a night. So, all you bargain hunters that are complaining...you get what you pay for. Room Tip: You WON'T get a clean room for $35 per night. See more room tips'
