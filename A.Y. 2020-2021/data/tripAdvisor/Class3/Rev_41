'I stayed there because I had a job interview in Paris and the behaviour of the staff was unforgivable and blatantly racist. It felt like I was somewhere in the deep south of the US or in apartheid South Africa circa 1950. Appalling. The worst offender was this French girl at the reception who at first refused to speak English despite the fact that it was obvious that I could not speak French and was aggressive and rude for no reason; she had a lack of people skills and behaved as if you were an intruder and not a guest. The fact that there are black and North African staff is not a redeeming feature as they seem to be the type that have self-loathing issues and are embarrassed of their origins. It was rather sad. Other people on this board have mentioned clean sheets, rooms and showers but if I am to be honest, it is the least that can be expected. I only stayed at this one and I wonder if the rude and inappropriate behaviour is the same at the rest of the MIJE hostels. I hope not. Overall very disappointing.
