'I stayed here for one night while visiting family who live just down the road from the hotel. All I needed was a clean room and bed to sleep in, I got no more and no less. My room was on the second floor, advertised as a double but the bed would be very tight if there were two people sleeping in it. Good points: The room was recently decorated, perfectly clean, quiet, all the lights worked, nothing was broken. Hot water came immediately and was very hot. The bed was OK. The area is off the beaten track, very typically Parisian and will appeal to people who like real local flavour rather than local flavour made for tourists. The nearest metro station (Jourdain) is about five minutes' walk. There is no breakfast but who would want a 1-star hotel breakfast anyway, when there are bakeries and cafes close at hand? Bad points: Some minor gripes - the bathroom was ridiculously small, impossible to wash, shave or shower without banging into things. The plug in the sink wouldn't close and the shower head wouldn't stay put, but I have seen this in four-star hotels as well so cannot really complain. The walls between rooms are very thin, luckily I had very quiet neighbours - I heard them coming in, banging into things in the bathroom then nothing else. Two major gripes. Firstly, it was unbearably hot in the room and impossible to turn down the heating. Consequently, I slept with the window wide open despite it being freezing outside. No doubt many others do the same, which makes no sense in terms of energy wastage and heating bills for the hotel. Luckily my room was out the back and so noise from the street was not an issue. And secondly, as in so many small Paris hotels, what happens if there is a fire? The only way out is apparently the main staircase which is steep, spiral and narrow. All in all, if your purpose is what mine was - a cheap bed for a night or two specifically in this part of Paris and nothing more, then this hotel fits the bill perfectly.'
