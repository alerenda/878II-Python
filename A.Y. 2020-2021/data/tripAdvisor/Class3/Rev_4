'I actually live in Cancun but needed a place to stay between moves and this is close to work. It was a little deceptive because I was under the impression that there was a bit of breakfast included. What it really was was a "make your own" breakfast, which offered cereal and eggs but milk you had to buy and store in the communal fridge. Depending on which room you're in, you can get an outside room which, most unfortunately, is right in front of another hostel/bar, which is up all night, blaring music. I am a heavy sleeper, which helped, but be forewarned because between loud music outside and the occasional spat amongst other fellow travelers, this is really for someone who is only looking for a place to sleep.'
