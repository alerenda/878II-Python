'Just returned from Hawksbill and want to go back. We have been 7 years in a row and will continue to. Yes the resort is showing signs of it's age but don't let that stop you from visiting. What may be lacking in decor is more than made up for by the staff. We are treated like family. The beaches at Hawksbill are by far the finest on all of the island. Not 1 or 2 ,but 4 beaches are available to the guests. Eden beach is absolutely beautiful ( clothing optional ) and is at least a half mile long and never crowded. The food is average but always fresh and hot. The drinks are always flowing and cold. If you're looking for gourmet dining this is not the resort for you. If you're looking for non stop activities and entertainment this is not the resort for you. IF YOU WANT RELAXATION AND ROMANCE THIS IS THE PLACE!!!!!'
