'Went to this hotel on a Caledonian coach tour. Basically you are treated like second class citizens. The food is terrible and the rooms small and basic and my room was particularly noisey due to late night revelers and early morning deliveries etc. . The staff were sullen and unhelpfull. Single room occupancy meant no choice and reception categorically refused to even consider any change of room. Although this hotel has a great location the fact you are with a coach tour seems to relegate you to sub standard unacceptable treatment. Would not recommend this hotel for those reasons.'
