'Last time I spend 1 night only and it was cold winter, few people only - this time it was 2 nights, summer in the city and full with other guests on trainings and conferences. The rooms are decent simple, a bit worn but everythings works - not much to highlight but even the single rooms have ca. 1,2m wide beds and you can open the window (in summer you can fell asleep with the sound of the sea). Bathroom is big but shows its age (not dirty but just old) Atmosphere in the huge complex in a beautiful park next to the beach is typical Finnish: it might be from the 70ies but it's in good shape and well maintened. many windows to let the light inside (in summer), breakfast was one of the best ever in Finland and the 3 Saunas and Sea access (beach) are a big plus (Sauna#3 with beach access to be booked and charged, others for free). I booked via tour operators at amazingly 60 EUR/night with bf for a single room - great value for a great experience - yes urban - not really in Helsinki (ca. 30min drive, taxi easily 40-50 EUR oneway) - however recommended if you have a car or just want to relax close to Helsinki for low money! Free Wifi only in the public area - in the rooms cable connection which is charged! Room Tip: all single rooms (1,2m bed) are on the outer complex, double rooms are in the main building See more room tips'
