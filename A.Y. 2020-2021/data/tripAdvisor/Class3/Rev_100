'We had to find somewhere in a hurry and ended up here at a cost of 800 pesos (~$60). It is central to downtown Cancun and some good restaurants. It was fairly clean, I think, but the sheets,towels and pillows were ancient. The walls are paper thin. For the same price you could get a far nicer hotel and probably with breakfast included. We did see kids enjoying the pool and a large quiet party under the palapa in the back.'
