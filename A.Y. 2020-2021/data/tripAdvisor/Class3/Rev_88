'I spent 2 nights there with my boyfriend and the initial price was too expensive but the owner managed to make it cheaper if we stayed there in a minimum of 2 nights.. we were tired and we run out of options. So we stayed there for 2 nights. The room is okay, the AC is really noisy and there is no hot shower. The kitchen is well furnished. WIFI is only in the lobby or in the first 2 floors. There is a bar in the corner next to this hostel that is really noisy and play music till late at night. So my advice for travellers is try to walk 5 minutes around from these place and you will find out a better offer for the same price or less.'
