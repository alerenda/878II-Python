'we stayed in the Pelicanos 6 years ago as a family and thoroughly enjoyed our stay so we decided to return as a couple. We have never been so disappointed ! We was allocated the Ocas on arrival our room that we was given faced the indoor market entrance so asked to change room we was charged 24 euros, a fridge was 30 euros but they didn't have any available, an hair dryer was a 30 euro deposit so was the tv remote control. We found the staff in the Ocas miserable and unhelpful, on passing through reception on a daily basis there were always a different person complaining about something. We found the rooms very sparse and uninviting and desperately in need of modernising. We stayed on a B&B basis and yes the breakfast was good with plenty of options. We just found every other area/ aspect disappointing ............be prepared to be up at 7 if you want a shaded area by the pool people sitting on chairs waiting for beds to come out just so that they could put there towels on and then go out for the day, there are signs up telling you not to do this but hotel staff didn't follow their poolside rules and remove towels from unoccupied beds. Really disappointed and would definately not go back. Room Tip: always ask for a pool view and stay on high floor. See more room tips'
