'Not a smooth booking through their own website, it took a while to get the confirmation. The directions to the place are OK if you are not driving in the dark (Canine Country Club is NOT a big sign). Room was only OK. The room was not clean during our entire three days stay. Breakfast was fine. We had the feeling that Aimee, the owner, was a bit over her head at times.'
