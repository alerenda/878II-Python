'Had a great holiday in Cancun, just awesome and couldn't really find fault with Aquamarinabeach hotel. Very friendly and helpful staff, great location right on the beach, plenty of activities in the day and the staff take you out at night to all the best clubs in town. Food did get a little boring and repetitive by the second week, but it wasn't by exactly bad at the same time. This place isn't the ritz but you still get more than you pay for here and represents fantastic value for money !'
