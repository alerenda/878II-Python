'Really want to offer a more objective opinion on Kin Mayab. Had they charged around $50 USD per night, we would have not much complaint, but they charge more than twice of that per night: for that, there is no in-room wi-fi; breakfast is not included; room and property are older than and not as brightly lit as the photos shown. Yes, it's very close to the main bus station; walking with luggage for 2min works; that extra convenience could be worth $5 USD more, but not $65 more since ADO is for airport and far away city connections, not your other downtown or ariund Cancun bus rides. For around $70, you could stay in Oasis America, as we learn in our research after we arrived locally, that's only a 20-30 peso, 6-min taxi ride down the street, which includes a very good buffet breakfast and well designed pool. The pool of Kin Mayab is actually located off the main premise, in the secondary building: the road connecting the two parts is old, unevenly paved concrete that's more like an external side street than an intergral part of any hotel. In any case, if the price is much more reasonable, this can be a value play; but for this price, we feel quite ripped off as we later stay at another hotel that's much newer and with much better amentites (breakfast included) for much less.'
