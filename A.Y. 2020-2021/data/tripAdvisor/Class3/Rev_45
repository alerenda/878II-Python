'My girlfriend and I just got back from a week long trip to the Flamingo Cancun Resort. We were not on the all inclusive plan as we had dive excursions planned almost every day of our trip. We only spent the afternoons and our last full day at the hotel. The rest of the time we were away. I only had breakfast every morning and I usually had it quickly as I was in a rush to go diving but what I did eat was fine and no complaints from me. Spent time at both pools no complaints, enjoyed both of them for different reasons. Drinks were easier to get a main pool but after tipping a waiter we were being waited on at other pool and on beach near beach pool. Upgraded to junior suite, for me was worth the extra cash, had a couple of times when I had to have the front desk give me a new key card but not a big hassle to walk to front desk. All hotel staff treating us well, no complaints. Location was great, wouldn't have wanted to been anywhere else. The bottom line is don't come here expecting the Ritz and you will be pleasantly surprised. We would return to the Flamingo without hesitating.'
