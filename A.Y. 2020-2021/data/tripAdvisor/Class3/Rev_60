'Stay at this hotel for 3 night and what a let down. This hotel needs a good over haul,the only plus for this hotel was the location and possibly the pool.the rooms were outdated the food was waiter service with very little choice. The bedroom was as bad, no bedside lights just main lights, the bathroom was the same, old brown hairdryer on the wall as you found in all hotels in spain in the 80s,and has got to be one off the smallest bathroom I have come across. This 4 star hotel should only be a 3 star with some serious updating, and it was not very good valve for money.'
