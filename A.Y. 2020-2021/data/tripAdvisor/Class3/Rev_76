'Usually I don't review to many accommodations but I feel like I should give people a heads up. I booked online via the Lucky Youth Website for a total of three nights. I received a confirmation email (Only after emailing them again) that I did have accommodation for the three nights. Upon arriving in Paris and following the arrival instructions I made the phone call and to my surprise the receptionist told me that I had booked to last minute and was only given a bed for the night. Very frustrating finding accommodation last minute while also being confirmed for the three nights. I ended up staying at St.Christopher’s Inn thankfully. Personally I wouldn't recommend this accommodation after my experience.'
