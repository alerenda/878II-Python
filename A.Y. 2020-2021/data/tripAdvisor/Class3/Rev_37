'I paid a good rate, however breakfast was not included. The room was quite small, a view of a disgusting alley. The bathroom and the free internet were the highlights. I actually slept well during the night, but during the day I could hear the hallway doors banging so loud, I jumped every time. There was also some knid of construction going on in the hotel every morning. Not sure where it was coming from, but definitely annoying. The hotel is located on Diagonal street, a 10 minute bus drive from La Rambla street where all the action is. Take the 59 or 14 bus. Visit Barceloneta beach. The sand is soft and beige, not white, the water is beautiful and turquoise. And yeah, eat at CDLC restaurant on Barceloneta at night. The service is amazing! And I'm a chef so I know what I'm talking about(hope that doesn't sound bad) Have the foie gras appetizer(amazing) and the sushi. Very impressed with that. And the rose by the glass is really good. Hope this helps.'
