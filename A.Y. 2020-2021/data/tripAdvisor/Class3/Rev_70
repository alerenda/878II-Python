'Location excellent. Old hotel under renovation. I would rate the newly renovated room that we had as 2.1/2 star. Australian travellers, you should note the three star accommodation in Paris is not like a three star in Australia; it's about 1.1/2 to 2 star In my opinion. I pre-booked the accommodation online (An American co's mystery offer, based on that company's good accom. in America) and chose it based on location. With retrospect, it was a risky thing to do, but it turned out that we had one of the better rooms the hotel offers. The offer was at a significantly reduced price and I have rated it based on that discounted price. If I had to rate it on its full cost I would be rating it much lower. We did stay an extra night and had to move to one of the lesser quality rooms. That room was very basic, all the furnishings were very old and shabby .
