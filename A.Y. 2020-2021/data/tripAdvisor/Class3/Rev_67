'While the outside is under construction the rooms inside are completed. We stayed in the Pumpkin Patch Room and it was Clean and Comfortable. There was a large bathroom with a new tile floor and Jacuzzi. The bed was a comfortable queen and the room was well lit with 3 new windows. The dresser is unique and there is a small closet is in the bathroom. There was a ceiling fan, basic TV and a pub table where your breakfast is served. Breakfast is simple and delicious - eggs, pancakes and sausage patties, Dave is a delightful owner - ready to help you in any way you need it. My wife suggests you visit the gift shop next door for some knickknacks and Yes we will be back because it was that good a value.'
