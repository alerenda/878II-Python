'As you approach this beautiful house your level of anticipation increases only to be flattened by rude staff and stuffiness. The reception staff were overworked, snobby and unwelcoming, but the porter Mark was fabulous so this made up for it. I honestly kept looking for positives as I had pushed to stay here after being guests here in the past. The chair cushions in our bedroom (£350 for two nights) were covered in dubious stains, the unlined mattress was two pushed together with a fat uncomfortable join right in the middle, and the bed was rock hard. The pillows were floppy and old. Our hard over-washed scratchy gowns had no belts and were not of any quality. My dog does better than this. I did not want to disappoint my husband by moaning as it was our Silver Wedding Anniversary so I did not mention anything to him. The level of cleanliness was just ok apart from this. We were put off dinner in the hotel and found a fabulous pub to dine in. However the two cups of tea for £7 were spolit by Mr Rude, he spoke badly to everyone, and ruined the atmosphere. Breakfast started off ok with a lovely mature waitress, only to be ruined by the rudest man I have ever dealt with, Mr Rude again. I thought it was John Cleese-esque/Fawlty Towers style, I actually looked for the camera. Breakfast was slow, still frozen vege sausage and the second day my poached eggs sat on a soggy circle of toast. When I asked for some toast, (not complaining and being very British about my ridiculous food) I got my head bitten off. I felt so shocked it ruined what should have been our celebration breakfast. We went to look at the spa and book something but there was no one there. By this time we had lost interest. We left a feedback note and when I told the receptionists the other guests waiting agreed with me and we were all so embarassed. Hand picked indeed.......by whom I wonder? I will not return here. The main business is obviously weddings and we are not of any consequence.'
