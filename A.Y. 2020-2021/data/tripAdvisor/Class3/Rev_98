'This is a mixed bag: inconsistent in its offerings. It's a bit more expensive than same-level quality hotels around the area. The rooms facing the street (the kind we stayed in) can hear cars driving by as Avienda Tulum is a main, busy street (we stayed at 6th floor and can still hear the noise - not loud that we can't fall asleep but denifinitely not quiet either). The rooms do not have in room Wi-fi, for which you have to come all the way down to first floor lobby area. The room we stayed in has paint peeled off around he coffe countertop; the shower head fell off when my partner was taking the shower. The room has nice, otherwise standard amenities with LCD TV. The hotel does offer very good buffet breakfast and a modern, well-designed pool area next to the breakfast area. It's close enough to main downtown area (a short 20-30 peso taxi drive away) as well. If it rectifies the inconsistency and wrong pieces, this can be a good value or even hidden gem. But as is, it's a mixed bag (and because of the falling shower head, we are taking one star off - that alone could make this a terrible place for the price (70+ USD), but its breakfast and pool area make up a bit). Service is subpar: check-in front desk at night was bad: English wasn't good (or service was just bad) as we asked for a quiet room but got assigned a street facing room that can hear car noises but the front desk conveyed to us he knew what 'quiet' means (this is Cancun, you would think 'quiet' is an easy English word at this international city, let alone to a hotel front desk); the promised repairer for shower head also never showed up as we were too tired afterward to track down further.'
