'just got back from one week there, 24/09/2011 Where do i start ? If your thinking of booking i would be tempted to say dont.But that would not be fair on the staff there, who seem to be working very hard and long hours.The young dutch lady who almost does everything from daily entertainment and all the evening entertainment with very little help with props or equipment works very hard.All the staff where very helpful and good at there jobs.But the management and owners of this hotel should hang there heads in shame , They obviously do not appreiciate there staff as it must be very hard to clean these worn out shabby rooms, although the cleaners where brilliant,This hotel, if thats what you can call it is held together by its Very hard working staff.But let down big time through lack of investment.There where doors with holes in with a bit of planks screwed over the holes , also ceiling tiles missing or just hanging and this was in the main reception gents toilets.The rooms stunk of damp , curtains where hanging off the rusted rails and the beds where well past there use by date , i had to turn my mattress over has a spring was sticking out of the mattress. Only to get another one on that side.On talking to another guest he said he had complained about his room and was upgraded to a superior room LIKE MINE only to find it was as bad as mine.On the plus side , the outside pool area and gardens where good and relaxing , again this was achieved by good staff.The management would do well to go on a course of hotel management training as they are badly letting there staff down.Shame it could be a good hotel.( Management needs to spend some money on the accommadation before its to late ) Room Tip: go somewhere else.
