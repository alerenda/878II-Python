'Kin Mayab is directly across from the bus station, which makes it an ideal stopping place for before or after exploring the Yucatan peninsula and Belize. It is economical and offers breakfast service, internet access and a pool for hot season comfort. Travelers to Mérida should know that flights to Cancun from the US are often much cheaper than going directly, and Kin Mayab is the place to stay if you need a break between flight and bus.'
