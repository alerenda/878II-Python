'Super large room with spacious balcony to catch the sunshine for most of the day. Food in the Italian Restaurant was good and well presented, with nice service. Staff courteous and warm (the barman remembered everyone's drinks!), with my room on floor 6 (the elevator only goes to 5) I would have had to lug my suitcase up the last flight of stairs but help was at hand as a kind person working in the hotel did the job for me! The room was very hot at night and, if one opened the patio doors, it was quite noisy outside as the hotel is in the middle of the village. Unfortunately, although the bathrooms had been renovated, the bedrooms had not and so there was an air of tiredness about the place, which looked very seventies in style, plus the lighting in the room was poor for working by. Room Tip: Floor 6 has big rooms and big balconies. See more room tips'
