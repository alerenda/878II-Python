'I wanted a budget hotel in Cancun city but I wasnt prepared for this. Its basic - very basic. And the street its on is more than a little scary for the typical American tourist that is used to personal space and American cities. I visited a lot of places in Europe but even I wasnt prepared for the area and the type of hotel. The tv remote didnt work, and the hot water heater broke the same day I was there. The aircon worked but it was it noisy. The corridor had 2 lights that were burned out and the room was noisy with a view of a VERY dirty building and alleyway. The staff was very nice though and transferred me to their sister hotel in the hotel district at no extra cost (since we had no water to bathe or drink).'
