'i thought we would be arriving to a spacious, inviting hotel, but no such thing. dear trip advisor... would you please ban the use of wide-angle shots by hotels - it is totally misleading and very disappointing when you arrive at your destination. the place was pokey small, no mirror in the room except in the bathroom which is very annoying if there are 2 people sharing. i agree with the other reviewer, the place had a stale smell about it which you simply couldnt get rid of even by keeping the window open wide for half an hour. hair dryer was coming off the wall and electrically unsafe. breakfast was adequate but didnt change in all our 4 mornings there. the cheese they serve was leathery and tasteless and if you didnt like it, then tough - there was no choice of cheese - given that this is Italy - one would expect a choice of irresistable cheeses. enough said. not the best place to choose - and definitely will not go there again!'
