'we were there seven days.. during which two solo travellers and one couple had items stolen. most suspect the owner of cleaners (the owner, Carlos, is quite an angry man putting it politely). he also refused to turn the aircon on until 11pm at night ! there is some good news , the hostel looks onto cancun's most attractive local square, where there is an english speaking police station amongst the food outlets, and they open early and help you complete the forms be cafeful if you decide to stay here !'
