'This is the worst place, those are not the real pictures of the place, is dirty, smells bad, not good parking lot, neighbors not friendly, at the end we pay more for our stay, no water, no light, no internet, no good food, no good service, rude people, this is a fraud. I can not understand why the Ministry of Tourism let them have a place like this open to the visitors and operates as hotel or hostel. This is a really bad place, scary, full of thieves and roaches.
