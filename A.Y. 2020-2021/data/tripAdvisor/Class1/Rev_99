'I had been backpacking across Europe and decided to "splurge" on a hotel room in order to stay on my own for a few nights. I was used to staying in 6-8 person bedrooms in hostels and, to my surprise, I found Hotel Horizonte to be one of the worst experiences of the trip. I would have preferred to stay in another hostel, to be honest. The deluxe room that I requested had furniture and bedspreads that were 30-40 years old (and likely unwashed), the internet did not work in the rooms, and food outside of the hotel was at least a 15-20 minute walk away and hard to find. This hotel is extremely run-down and reminded me of a very old, rural motel in the US. On a positive note, the pool was really nice, the views of the harbor were incredible, and the staff was very warm and helpful. It would definitely be worth spending the extra money to stay at another nearby hotel or go to the resort area in Magaluf or Palmanova.'
