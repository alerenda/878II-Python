'I would like to say all of the staff are GREAT and helpful its just to bad the property isn't better maintained.They have put down new floors and painted however the house keeping staff needs to do a deep cleaning there is grime on the outside of the tubs hair in the tubs the faucets in the shower are tarnished and hard watered stain good old vinegar and a Mr clean earaser would work wonders.The furniture needs to be upgraded bad... the beds are old and hard the pillows are awful I opened up my pillow case and they were stained. Grime on the front of the tv stands/dressers and I went and bought my own dish soap to re wash dishes just because I wasn't sure.. Didn't see any cleaning supplies on maids cart.It also needs new drapes and bedding and light fixtures it would brighten the place up 100
