'I went to Cancun with a group of friends in May 2011. what seemed to be the dream trip became the trip of horrors. We bought our stay through a website and we were delighted by the photos, however, I must say that not everything that is beautiful in the picture reflects the reality! We've had already heard stories of people who were robbed in the hotel and also about the slowness of the officials but everything we went through was horrible. During our stay more than 3 Occurrence of theft happened at the hotel!! Absurd!! Until we were the victims. Several items qere stole from my brother in law and my sister's bags were stirred. They were on honeymoon! Just imagine what a "great" honeymoon they had... and the hotel staff did nothing about it. even worse...They acted as if nothing had happened, they didn't even called the police and didn't take any responsibility for the damage. My friends and I absoluttley "do not" recommend this hotel to anyone!!!!! If you want to be stolen, all you have to do is check in!!!!!'
