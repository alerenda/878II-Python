'The person checking us in was wonderful - very friendly and nice. That was the only good thing about the hotel other than a mini-fridge for personal use in the room. First, the key/lock apparatus to the room wouldn't work, so we had to stay in a different room. Second, the room smelled horrible (bug spray?). Third, the tub enamel was chipped and there was no place to hang a wash cloth or put one's shampoo/conditioner. Fourth, the knob for the shower fell off. Fifth, the amenities consisted only of soap and shampoo (we had to search for the scratchy tissues, but we found them) - no conditioner. The shampoo left a film on one's hair. Sixth, there was no hair dryer. Seventh, no closet or place to hang clothing. Eighth, one of the beds had specks that were reminiscent of bed bugs. Ninth, the continental breakfast was disgusting - a loaf of white bread, two small muffin/sweet pastry packages (think the cheapest item in a convenience story, unrefrigerated orange juice, two plastic containers of cereal, one of the brightly colored sugary variety, and a quarter full pot of coffee. Even the coffee was so unappetizing that we bought it down the road. Even a "not the Ritz" hotel should be better than this.'
