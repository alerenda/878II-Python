'This has got to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The room was filthy the beds were stained the floor was dirty, stained and sticky, the walls were covered in splashes of god only knows what, the 'pillows' which were the French style bolster were rock hard and very smelly. The shower was mouldy and the shower head was broken, and lying on the floor of the shower when we arrived. We had to ask for towels. We were booked in for 2 nights as a family of 2 adults and one child, but could not possibly stay the two nights, it was too disgusting, so we lost 69 Euros due to the 24 hour cancellation policy.'
