'Room in the basement orribly dirty! Small window opening under a balcony... dark, smelly, muddy... disgusting. Disgusting floor... Forniture falling apart... light not working... bathroom with no air circulation (so that they provide a large deodorant spay!)... Linen and bed were fine... the problem is evidently in the inhouse service. Not cheap enough for such service.'
