'The reviews about the Hostel Kabeh made us desperate to stay there but the reality was distinctly unpleasant. The two dorms are miniscule and uncomfortable, with barely enough space to move around. I understand that the Kabeh is a microhostel, but when i woke up and hit my head on the ceiling, i was less than understanding then. The hostels communal areas are almost non existant, and the tiny lounge and kitchen were both dirty and untidy. The one bathroom we were allowed to use was small but bearable. There were several good options for breakfast but we were put off from cooking by the unclean kitchen utensils and cooker. We have since moved on from Cancun and found other wonderful hostels, so it was so disappointing to have got our trip off to such an unenjoyable start. To rub salt into the wound, the Kabeh Hostel is overpriced for the service you receive. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Room Tip: You have the choice of two cramped dorms. See more room tips'
