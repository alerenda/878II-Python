'It was 1 event after another starting with the lifeguard asking our kids to remove poop from the pool. We had to fight for plates, cups and food when they sold day and weekend passes. We had tiny bugs in our room, had to get bailed out of a glass bottom boat while it was taking in water, couldn't see the bottom of the pool, it was so filthy and had a yellow film on the top. Lastly 9 out of 15 of us were sick upon returning. Enough with Breezes, we will never go back there even with the free night we received to Negril for our troubles. Too bad all the breezes have the same bad reviews'
