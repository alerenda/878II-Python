'For the price we paid RIDICULOUS! Allow me to make this short and sweet. We stayed overnight for an Aerosmith concert @ Times Union Center. Location to arena great! Otherwise trip was horrible. Check-in went smooth. Parking is a fee and you have a choice on street or to pay a ridiculous fee for valet. Room were semi okay. Some decor severely outdated. Rugs were awful full of stains!!! No ice machines, pop machines nothing! Worst part is we went to the bar! We approach the bar with a large group. First thing bartender said was "i can't serve any of you guys" when we all are in our mid 20's to late 40'S. To make it worse when we proved her wrong on our age there was NO BUDLIGHT! We ask for shots, NO SHOTS. The server claims this is because "they are too classy" Bartender was so rude it ruined this whole trip. I can go on and on and on but i really dont recommend this hotel at all!!'
