'Before I go into the story of our stay, I want to THANK Nicki (not sure of spelling) for all the time she spent trying to find us a clean room. She was a gem. I hope she is being paid more than minimum wage. You really want to keep this gal. She really went out of her way to be polite and helpful. BEWARE, Check room first. We had stayed here before BUT it was clean! We were moved 3 times before we got a clean room. I had broken a toe on Friday so I was is a little pain which became worse after moving from room to room. We were sad to see that the housekeeping staff had gone down hill. What owners don't seem to realize is this is where their business starts and some newbies need to be trained. Pay the good works well and toss the others! The head housekeeper needs to be held responsible for the traininga and held responsible when cleaning is substandard. Room Tip: See above!
