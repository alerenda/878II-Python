'The website makes it look like a nice enough mom-and-pop spot, but when we arrived it was clear that we should have maybe gone there in person first to inspect it. It was absolutly the most filthy, musty, humid, uncool place ever. And I have stayed at plenty of cheapie, no-frills places! This was quite the nightmare. Dirty carpets, trash and mouse droppings in the dressers, unfriendly staff, grotesque kitchenette, funky bedspreads, filthy and moldy bathroom (complete with stopped up sink and bloody phlegm on the ripped shower curtain), strange condensation all over the blinds (extremely high humidity probably created the mold and must?)...it looked and felt as if the people running the place took absolutely no pride in running the place. Which is such a shame, because it's located in a nice and convenient spot in Saugerties. With the proper care, it could be more than a one-time visit kind of place. But as it stands, I'd like to save others the awful experience - don't stay at this inn!!! I had already paid and it was late, so that's the only reason we stayed! But you'd better believe I got my family outta there waaaaay before check out time! I didn't even let my kids (who were dirty and in need of cleansing) use the shower! Ugh. Don't go to this place, folks.'
