'My family and I just vacationed in Cancun and stayed at Holiday Inn Express, as soon as we walked in, the lobby smelled bad, like a old wet towel. Once we got into our room, it seemed clean to the naked eye but then we found a dead cockaroach next to the bed, rat feces in the bathroom and the tub was very dirty and there was hair all around the sink as if it was not cleaned after the last occupant. We immediately went to the front desk to request another room. They did change our room but the other one was exactly the same, very dirty. We told the person that followed us to inspect the previous room that this one was just as gross, we found two dead spiders, and the bathroom was not clean, and the air conditioning didn't work very well. He said he would send someone to fix it immediately. The result was a lady from housekeeping came in and sprayed the room down with raid and suggested we didn't breathe! Later when I grabbed a towel, i noticed a big yellow stain on it so i grabbed another one, the next one had about ten small pellets of rat feces that fell out if it as i opened it. We were disgusted and tried to check out immediately, as we went back to the lobby, some one else was complaining about another dirty room! I would definitely never go back and do not recommend this hotel. There are much better hotels in cancun and closer to the tourist areas for less money.'
