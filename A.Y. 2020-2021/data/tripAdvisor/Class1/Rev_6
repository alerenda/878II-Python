'Stayed here for 2 weeks and there is no A/C. I was sleeping in sweat and it is not worth the $5 dollars. You should just pay $10 more to Hotel Sotavento. I was too hot to move though. There is no roof when walking down stairs. The dining area is terrible and filthy, but I see a lot of nice looking people there!!! Someone took all my shampoo, conditioner and body soap. Everything is old and there are bugs in the room. There is no mesh to the window. Very disgusting and traumatizing.'
