'I rented a condo from a man named onsy from dallas. I arrived room not available! Front desk laughed at me! He then tried to charge me for the cleaning of changing the rooms when I FINALLY got the correct room! Elevator never works! Wifi broke half the time! Then I wanted to rent a few extra days. He threatened to change locks if payment wasn't done within 2 hours! Horrible man! No microwave! No deadbolt on door! No glasses or plates! The hot plate wasn't even bolted down! Imagine cooking on that! Mario the cabana guy was the only bright spot in the trip. He's a doll!'
