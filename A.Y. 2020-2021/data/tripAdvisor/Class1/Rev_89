'This Motel ahd very Ploor Quyality for a Rate of $100 per Night. The 1st Room we checked into smmelled like Vomit. The people at the Service Desk were very Nice & appolagized & moved us to another Room. The 2nd Room had Multiple Problems still. The Problems were as Follows: Bathtub/Shower had Stains that were just Nasty & Drain did not work very well at all as when you took a Shower you ended up standing in Ankle Deep Dirty water. Deadbolt on door was Broke. Tub also was Chipped & Re Caulking looked terrible. It would not recommend this Motel to anyone i know. Very Poor Quality for such High Prices of $100 per night. They totally need to ReModel this Building that we had stayed in. Sincerely Wes & Diane Room Tip: As we were in an Older Building that was for Pets i do believe, maybe the Newer Building may be OK...
