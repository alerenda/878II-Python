'We weren't expecting much, since we paid very little for such a great location. However..what we found was just horrific. The service was non-existant, the workers either didn't know english or chose not to speak it. We were not offered any helpful guidance about the area and instead were given a terrible map. The pictures online are extremely misleading. Nothing is even close to being clean. We thought we had booked a 'Twin Room', however were presented with a filthy broken shoebox, containing one bunk-bed and 2 tiny folding chairs. Using our bodies, we estimated the room to be approximately 39sq ft. Both mattresses were uncomfortable and one of them was even capable of folding completely in half, which led to a painful sleep. The bunk-bed was also being held together at the top with plastic ties. The room became cold quickly, given that the window wasn't sealed correctly, a latch was missing and the radiator was broken. The curtain was similar to an old bed sheet, double the length of the window, extremely thin, letting in most of the light. The room however, was just the tip of the iceberg once we had seen the bathrooms. Filthy, smelly and unhygienic, the bathrooms made showering a nightmare. There was hair covering the drains and they looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months. Room Tip: Don't stay at the Apache hostel. See more room tips'
