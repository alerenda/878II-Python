'We booked this through a travel agent in Australia and thought it sounded good as it said it was an all inclusive hotel. The 5 of us arrived about 9:30pm and they could not find out booking as the lady who does reservations had gone home and they could not be bothered to find out any more information for us. They made us pay for our first night AGAIN. They found our booking in the morning, with no apology may I add, and reluctantly agreed to refund the first night we paid for. The really bad - the hotel was pretty much deserted except for a couple of families that didn't look like guests of the hotel. It was dirty and rundown throughout. Only had one working elevator (had read months before going that it had only one working!) Where poeple had left plates up to be cleared, they were still there the following day - after rooms had been cleaned. The rooms themselves were crappy, dated, dirty and didn't include ANYTHING. No safe either, which wasn't good as we already felt unsafe. lastly, the location was way out of the tourist area for shopping/nightlife and the only way into town is find your own public transport. Only stayed till early the next morning, then went and found another hotel!'
