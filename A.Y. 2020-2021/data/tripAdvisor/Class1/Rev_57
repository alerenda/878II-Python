'We booked a 5 night stay in these apartments, because we were landing on Good Friday our travel agent checked 3 times that the offices that we had to use for key collection WOULD be open, what a suprise CLOSED, so we had to take a Taxi to the Buenavista Apartments costing 11 euros to leave 100 euros deposit and collect keys. On Saturday morning we went to the office that we had been told we could use for key collection and returns to arrange to return the keys to them when we left, only to be told that we could not use that office and had to return the keys to the Buenavista Aparments only. On arrival at the apartment i switched on light and recieved a small shock, on looking at the switch it was split. I have to say that this was a MINOR fault compared to everything else. We left our cases unpacked and went to look for alternative accomodation, but due to it being Easter we drew a blank unless we wanted to pay 150 euros for 1 night. I could list numerous points to deter anyone in their right mind from staying in Apartment 10A. The 1 and ONLY positive which i do want to over look is that the bedding was spotless clean. We visit Benidorm 2 to 3 times each year and will not let this 1 bad apartment spoil our enjoyment of this great holiday resort.'
