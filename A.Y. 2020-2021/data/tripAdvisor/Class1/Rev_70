'This hotel is a joke! Public areas of this hotel are kept falsely attractive and looks nice from outside and in the lobby, however when you get your room key - that's the time you will get your shock !! features of your 4 star bedroom are (1) Spring bed without mattress (2) iPad sized pillows (3) Dirty and filthy cupboards (in fact I found a dry eaten rotten sausage in the cupboard!!) (4) Miniature soap for one time only hand washing! (5) Super dry your skin shower gels (6) Rude and disrespectful staff (7) Restaurant for breakfast looks like a hospital canteen (8) Restaurant staffs have careless attitude they stand there doing jack! (9) Internet is 24 euros per day and you have connect a little cable to the wall socket and get your backside on the desk chair (10) Internet don't even work (11) TV system is 15 years old CRT TV system! I checked-out immediately the next morning - although I was booked for 5 nights! ** AVOID ** This non-VIP and non-Executive hotel at all costs! Else risk of asthma, disease, and feeling of morning grumpiness based on worse bed of the world is yours!
