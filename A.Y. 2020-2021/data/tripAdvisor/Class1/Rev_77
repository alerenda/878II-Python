'+ : location, near piazza de spagna, easy to access. - : service (no sens of client, "do as you want I can't help" when a reservation had been badly handled), dust ni rooms, noise early in the morning, ni battery in the TV remote, dirty blanquet, plastic bathtube, Paint tins and Used tray in the corridor during 2 days... Poor breakfast (same pineapple cut fresh the first day during 3 days...). Not worth 330€/night for two at all!!!! Internet access: 15€/24:00, do not work but noone to fix it. Stay away from this place'
