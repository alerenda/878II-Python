'I've been travelling for two decades, I write for a series of travel guides and websites. My two night stay at Maya Brick was without doubt the worst stay I've ever had in a hotel. Cockroaches, no hot water arrogant staff, no access to the pool as it was full of scubadivers, tv didn't work, manager was total jerk, I would avoid this place if I was you.'
