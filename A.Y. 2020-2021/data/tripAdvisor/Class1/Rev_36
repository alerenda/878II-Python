'I told them I need a smoke free room and they assured me that I would have. The one side of each hallway is smoke free, the other side the is smoking. I am allergic to cigarettes and have been suffering from allergies since arrival. The lobby, elevator and hallways ALWAYS smell strongly of cigarettes. Half the cable channels are fuzzy. The dvd player is balacing poorly on top of television. Some lights bulbs needed replaced when I arrived, Stove top burners are touchy, I have to position them every time I want to use them. The dishes and trash cans were not cleaned properly on arrival. The staff is always friendly and helpful but rarely at the desk. I always have to ring bell or call for someone to come out from inside office. I told them I would not be using hotel cleaning service. I can do a better job of cleaning and I have not used the service. They refuse to wave fee for room service even though I have done the work myself. Bed is NOT comfortable.'
