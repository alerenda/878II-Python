'The apartments are 3 bedroomed and 2 bathrooms, 1 with bath, 1 just a shower so despite each room being quite small the apartments are spacious. Some are owned by the Crystal Park hotel and others are privately owned. On booking we requested 2 apartments near each other (2 adults and 4 kids in 1 and elderely mother in the other). The aprtments were not even in the same block so involved walking down the street and using the intercom which doesn't work i.e. impossible so the 7 of us had to use just 1 apartment. The walls are made of hollow brick with no soundproofing and there is a lot of noise during the day, evening and throughout the night, not the best with a baby. For self catering the room is cleaned once a week, involving clean towels and sheets and for us that happened the day before we left. You have to take your own rubbish out each day. The kitchen is well equipped but with few utensils available cooking is near impossible. The view over the park is lovely but there are a few odd characters around which was not the best with young children or an old lady. The street the apartments are on is covered in dog doo - maybe someone could teach the Spanish to use a pooper scooper. Also there is no reception and you get dropped off at the hotel and no one is available to take you to the apartments which although only a 5 minute walk away is a bit confusing especially in the early hours with lots of luggage. The staff at the hotel seem determined to be rude and unhelpful. So all in all wouldnt recommend it unless you are planning coming in very late every night and collapse but then you can expect to be woken early. Room Tip: Chose a different hotel See more room tips'
