'We reserved 5 nights and left after 3 and by the time we left we didn't even care about the money they wouldn't refund. I agree with the others who were disappointed by the cabana's. There was an extention cord fed into the room with a light bulb, no other electricity and only the light for 5 hours. The paths are hard to navigate because they are unlit and rocky. The restaurant is beautiful but the food and service is mediocre. I loved the location, but they didn't even have a towel to offer their guests. Sergio is very handsome, but he needs to find a new occupation. He lacks the customer service gene. In the end we paid for 5 nights, they overcharged us by over $100 dollars, which we paid a year in advance, and we left after 3 days with a very small refund.'
