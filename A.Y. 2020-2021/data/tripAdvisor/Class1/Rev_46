'For starters...if you are used to satying at a Holiday Inn Express, Motel 6, Days Inn, Red Roof Inn, etc. with an all inclusive addition to your stay?? THEN THIS IS INDEED YOUR ONE STOP SHOP. However, if your tastes are geared towards a Ritz-Carlton, Le Blanc Spa, Palace Resorts, Royal Resorts, Club Med, Royal Hideaway, Grand Velas All Suites & Spa Resort?? RUN..RUN..RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED AND UPSET, TO SAY THE LEAST. All I can say is....Why in the HELL did I allow my husband to talk me in to saving $101.30 total per night as a couple to stay at this dump instead of the GRAND VELAS which is next door to this property. Yes, $101.30 PER COUPLE DIFFERENCE PER NIGHT FOR A OCEAN VIEW SUITE WITH PREMIUM PACKAGE BANDS. I BEG YOU TO BE THE JUDGE...PLEASE BEFORE YOU SPEND MONIES AND WAISTE YOUR TIME.'
