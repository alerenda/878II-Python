'I have never written a review to complain before but don't want anyone to have their holiday ruined by staying there. This hotel shouldn't be a three star if even a one star. We were so shocked at what we experienced. Everything from Sophie on reception to old dated looking small rooms, small bed ,bathroom, small old looking lift that we had to turn sideways to get into. We asked if we could change but were told that was all they had available by Sophie. My husband had emailed a week or so beforehand to explain that our trip was a very special occasion. We spent the first day of our holiday walking around trying to find another hotel but they were either all to expensive or weren't available for the four nights. We stayed out late ever night so we didn't have to spend so much time in the hotel. It ruined what was ment to be a special occasion and we will never stay there again.'
