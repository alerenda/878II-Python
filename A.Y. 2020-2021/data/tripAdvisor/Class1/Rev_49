'This hotel and Expedia ruined our anniversary. I spent more money on food and transportation to get there then the actual trip cost. The website has no back bone to stand on and the activties listed ARE LIES! Property Amenities Solymar Cancun Beach Resort offers both all-inclusive room rates and room-only rates. All-inclusive rates include on-site meals and beverages, taxes, and gratuities (tips). Additional charges may apply for meals at some restaurants(there is one buffet that serves all meals), special dinners (never offered or are you talking about the left overs from two days prior)and dishes, certain beverages, and other amenities. Simply step outside to unwind on the hotel's beach. At Solymar Cancun Beach Resort you can cool off in one of the 2 outdoor swimming pools and indulge in a pampering afternoon at the full-service spa (full service.. where... there is a beach massage that is offered to everyone who comes by and the people at the hotel don't even have a Chance to book it). The hotel offers a snack bar/deli (you mean the hockey pukes for burgers with no buns or the water down cheese sauce with stale chips . Guests can unwind with a drink at one of the hotel's bars, which include a swim-up bar, a poolside bar, and a bar/lounge (which was closed the entire time we were there). High-speed wired and wireless Internet access is complimentary (only if you are sitting in the lounge and get the access code). On site parking is complimentary.
