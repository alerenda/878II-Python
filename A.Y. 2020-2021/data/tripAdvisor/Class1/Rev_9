'me and my friend stayed in this place and the lockers are bad. Our Ipods disappeared from the locker eventhough the door was locked and so was the locker. We were the only 2 people in the room so there is no way that it wasn't someone who works there. DO NOT STAY AT THIS PLACE. Location is decent but you will have your stuff stolen. When we brought it up they only said they couldn't do anything. This place ruined our trip, don't let it do the same to you'
