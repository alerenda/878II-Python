'spent 11 days here and did not use the pool facilities at all, dirty with hair, plasters and other rubbish washed up on the pool steps. Stained bed sheets and towels, hygeine is basic and this hotel cant get this right. Resort was beautiful shame that this hotel ruined our stay, i read the reviews before our stay and thought that surely the bad comments arent true however they are. Dark and dirty coridoors with beds and hooovers left in them, not exactly child friendly. Significant investment needed and cant believe a holiday company would sell this as a 'kids hotel'. Go at your own peril!!!!!!! Room Tip: dont book it in the first place See more room tips'
