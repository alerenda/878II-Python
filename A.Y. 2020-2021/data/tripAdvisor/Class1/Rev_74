'I stayed here for an evening while competing at the HITS horse show and wish I had slept in my car. The first room I had had hair in the shower and a broken towel rod. I complained and was moved to another room which was even more dirty. Again there was hair in the shower in addition to a used bar of soap. There was also hair in the bathroom and a hole in the wall near the door. I complained again and was offered the chance to move again but it was midnight by this point. The woman at the front desk said she would speak to the manager. The next day there was still hair in the shower. Clearly the room had not been cleaned despite the manager's claim he had cleaned it himself. He was also very nasty and hostile when I finally had the chance to speak to him in person. Do not stay here under any circumstances!'
