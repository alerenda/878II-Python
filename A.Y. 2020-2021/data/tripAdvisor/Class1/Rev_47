'This condo complex passed a new ordnance via the Home Owners Association (March 2012) that does not allow renters effective immediately. All access points have security guards - access is limited to owners and if you are not you will not be granted access. If you reserve a unit here make sure you have a back-up place to stay because you will be left out in the cold! BEWARE!!!'
