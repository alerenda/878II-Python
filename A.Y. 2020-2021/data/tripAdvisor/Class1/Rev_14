'On arrival we were taken to our "room" which was nothing short of a garden shed, we had booked a sea view but ended up in this little shed thing in the garden. The door had a huge gap underneath it , the safety deposit box was hanging off the wall, the bed/sitting room light did not work and there was no hot water. We returned straight back to reception to complain and were told that there was no other room available but that we could move the next morning. We went to the reception the next morning to be told that there was still no room available and we would have to stay in the shed. Luckily our Rep arived and had a chat with the reception guy, surprise we were taken around the hotel and given the choice of two rooms. Neither had a sea view but at least they were clean and had electricity and hot water. If our rep had not interveined on our behalf I don't think we would have had a hope. We were staying all inclusive but it was the worst version of all inclusive we have ever found. If you did not get to the restaurant as soon as it opened you had very little choice of what was there to eat. The two bars ranout of wine 6 times in the two weeks we were staying there.They ran out of vodca gin and teqila one night. The only way to get the drink you wanted was to be a good tipper, not quite my idea of all inclusive. Although we did eventually end up with a fairly decent room on two ocasions we returned to our room in the afternoon to find the shower tray bubbling up with raw sewage, the smell was awful. As our room was on the second floor I was unsure of who's sewage it was. They sent a plumber up to put some strong chemical powder down which seemed to clear it but only for two days then it happened again, thank heavens it was then time to come home.'
