'This was the worst place I've ever stayed. Why? Here are the reasons: 1. Door lock broken, hotel was sold out, so could not move to another room. 2. Door didnt shut properly, meaning that debris blew in around the door. 3. Housekeeping did not clean room. 4. Housekeeping did not provide supplies (soap, shampoo) 5. Bed was uncomfortable. 6. Pillows were more uncomfortable than the bed. 7. Shower had no temperature control. One second it was cold, the next it was hot, then back to cold. Sometimes it stayed on either cold or hot and you could do nothing but suffer through it. 8. Parking was an incredible pain in the rear. The spaces were extremely narrow and extremely shallow. On sold out nights, good luck getting in and out of your car, since you have to park so close. 9. Area was sketchy at best. 10. It was dirty all over. 11. It is between a busy street and an extremely busy highway, the noise was incredible. In short, I'll never stay again and highly recommend staying elsewhere. Room Tip: Do not stay here!
