'Me and 5 friends came for springbreak, originally meant to stay in oasis palm beach but got changed to the viva 2 days before we flew out, we were assured it was on the same par if not better.... It was far from that! The staff were rude and very unhelpful, the maids didnt clean our sheet for 3 days they just remade the beds! at the end of our holiday they went another 4 days without cleaning so we had dirty towels stacked up. Our door was very stiff, and they started chiseling at the wall outside our door at 8 in the morning without telling us, this went on to break the door, they told us to leave for a different room which i refused as they said it would have no balcony or sea view. Thomas cook did not care about that we were unhappy, this was a family hotel but mainly over 2 weeks just locals, spanish or brazilian who couldnt speak english and were plain rude. Worst first experience for springbreak! Miami next stop ;)'
