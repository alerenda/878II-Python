'This is clearly not a 4 star hotel. Maybe a 2 at most. I traveled Europe for 3 weeks and this was the only hotel we stayed in that was not good. Actually, the worst hotel I've ever stayed in and I have traveled a lot in the past few years. Our first room was on the second floor and there was no internet. The website said you have free-wifi in rooms and in lobby but you only have free wi-fi if you stay in the lobby or are on the first floor of the hotel. The room was also very small and tiny, and had mildew in the bathtub. I called the front desk and politely told the guy the internet wasn't working and the room smelled like smoke and we do not smoke and don't like the smell. He said there was nothing he could do. I then asked for a manager and he told me he was out of the country but I could talk to him tomorrow. I then said I wanted to speak to him now and he finally agreed to change our room. He then changed us to a room on the first floor, and although the internet worked, the A/C did not, and this room also smelled like smoke. There are also stains on all of the carpets in both rooms we were in. Thank god we were only staying here one night. Room Tip: wifi does not work on second floor and up. rooms all smell like smoke. air conditioner does not work... See more room tips'
