'We flew into Cancun and had a transportation to the ferry so we could get to Isla Mujures and when we got to the ferry dock they had closed them becuase of the rain. So our transportation guy brought us to this hotel and just dropped us off with no other choice. It appeared to be a little scetchy but we did have a choice. The guy at the front desk was very nice and helpful but that didn't make up for the room that we had to stay in. We opened the door to our room and there was standing water on the floor and it smelled really musty. We called the front desk and they came and cleaned up the water. We then walked into the bathroom and there was mold on the wall by where the towels hung and there was mildew in the shower, needless to say we didn't take showers. We were exhausted but didn't really want to go to sleep because I'm pretty sure we could hear gun shots outside. I'm not sure how we could have slept anyway because the bed was like sleeping on a concrete slab. So we put the chair under the front door and waited for 5:30am so we could catch the first ferry to the island.'
