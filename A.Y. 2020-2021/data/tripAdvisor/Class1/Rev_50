'all complex needs a urgent renovation, no air con at all(rooms, restaurant etc) as a half board we had a b/fast and dinner. we ate dinner 3 nights out of 7 only because the food was really poor quality. Restaurant always full, very not easy find the table. Way too many germans around. All staff very nice and friendly only to them, and treated us as we were invisible. If you're couple at around 30 this is definitely not place for you, because the average age of holidaymakers is around 55-60!! we were feeling there as a freaks. Overall i wouldn't state this hotel as a 4 star accomodation! Max 3!!! no more then that!! Room Tip: there isn't any good rooms at this hotel/complex See more room tips'
