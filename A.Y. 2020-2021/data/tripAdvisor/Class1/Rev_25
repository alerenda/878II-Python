'Heavy handed tactics, intimidation, threats, theft, lies, and an eviction on a short notice, nothing seems underhanded enough for Francesca. All of these and more were used to evict me after a stay of five months at that hotel. I paid on time, was a quiet client, and the staff liked me. Francesca, who can become hysterical at any moment and hasn't a clue about conducting a business, also has a problem controlling her tongue. She accused me of destroying a chair. Assuredly, this was the product of normal wear and tear, and I stated that hotels are covered by insurance for this sort of thing. This sent her into a hysterical fit, and she resorted to all of the above tactics in order to get rid of me. Great way to treat a client, the only client at the time, for the place was near empty when this happened! If I were you, I would consider any other place than this for my vacation. There are many far better hotels in and around Tulum, so there is no lack of options.'
