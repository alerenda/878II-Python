'This hotel online states bilingual staff whicilih isn't the case for every staff member. Half the time nobody understood us which is frustrating. The information books in the rooms have false shuttle times to and from the beach, false breakfast hours, the swim up bar isn't even utilized by the staff. Nobody asked for identification or a credit card at check in. I'm not sure why Carlson hotels don't have same standards as the next. This hotel also didn't advertise Carlson except in the rooms. The room was dirty towels were stained bed I'd hard as a rock.'
