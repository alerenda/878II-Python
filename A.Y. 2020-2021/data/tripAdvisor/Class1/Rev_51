'Please dont stay here. I; in one of their hostels right now. Our so called guide met us at the train station 50 minutes late and was incredibly rude-a bit sexist-and generally inept. We were given a bed and a futon, not two beds like we booked. The next day there was no water in the entire apartment building with no warning from either the management of the company nor the guide who had led us there the day before. We called management who yelled at us for being American and expecting water. The management refused to appologize for the mishap and continued to verbally abuse us until we finally hung up, feeling completely ripped off. The apartments are all shared between at least 9 people, it is not comfortable, the location is only mediocre, the whole system is incredibly sketchy and juvenile. If you are a competent adult with the abilities to slightly navigate a city, avoid this place at all cost. P.S. there is a cockroach in our kitchen.'
