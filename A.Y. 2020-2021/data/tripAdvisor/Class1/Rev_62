'Don't waste your money!! I went with a friend for the weekend. I had been looking forward to it for months but was disappointed in every way. The tennis instruction was mediocre, the food bland, and the accommodations straight out of the 70s. Our weekend was overbooked (they added a bunch of people two days before off the waitlist when the weather forecast looked good) so when there was the threat of rain on Sunday, they knew there would not be enough indoor court space for everyone and had everyone play for 6 hours in one day on Saturday. Youre better off taking a few private or semi-private lessons.'
