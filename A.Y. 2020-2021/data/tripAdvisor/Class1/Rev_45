'On March 2010 Me, My Mum, My Dad, My Nan and My Sister went on holiday to Mexico we were excited and happy after getting of the pane after a 12hour flight to Mexico and after that we had a 1 hour trip in a taxi to the hotel.We hoped it was worth it but it wasn't worth it!!! I rather go to turky!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ROOM: My room didn't have * A toilet seat * A plug for the bath and sink * A bed that wasn't broken * A sea view WHAT A DISGRACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
