'We went to this place and expected a nice clean quiet place. Rather their was construction all day long nearby and guys always around gawking at us and making my wife feel unsafe. The staff is creepy and seemed they were always looking for a handout. The place is old and outdated in need of a complete renewal. The rates are that of a five star luxury all inclusive resort. Very low quality...not recommended to anyone!!!!! I'
