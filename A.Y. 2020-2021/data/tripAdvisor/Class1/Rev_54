'I rented a private room with bathroom mainly because the thought of sharing a bathroom grosses me out, but this place is awful. Don't get me wrong, I know this is a hostel and I have travelled and stayed in many hostels all over but this place is gross. The bed was so soft only god knows how old the matress was. The pillocases were stained and there were hairs on mine!! I had to take a towel of mine and put it over to bear the thought of sleeping in this bed. Also they advertised themselves as a hostel with AC, but they do not tell you you actually have no control over yours! it is remotely operated and they only turn it on 4 hours a day and 4 at night, because yeah, when I booked I was thinking at how nice it would be to rest after a long day at the beach in a hotel with no AC when I thought I was paying for one. Yes the location is fine but not even in a million years I would stay here again. This used to be a mall that was abandonded and they decided to make rooms out of what used to be stores. They do not have a safe but each room has a locker type of thing where you "can leave your stuff" , of course that is with your own lock don't expect them to provide anything. The front door seems like a joke, like anyone with a hairpin could open it. Of course, I wouldn't let ANY of my valuables in, it was even stressing to sleep in there. I am sure there are other decnt hotels at decent prices so you don't have to stay here, avoid this place!!'
