'This hotel was horrible! Room 135 - stinking and doggy... unfriendly and unhelpful staff... we took some pictures of this "4-star hotel". Shame! Fortunately we had to stay only 2 nights. This place should be closed for proper renovation and CLEANING! We have been travelling a lot, staying at 2/3/4/5 star hotels but this one (the room) should not be given even 2 stars. When we asked for a better room we were told that 135 was the best one. Perhaps you can compare 135 and 141 which we have seen at the end.
