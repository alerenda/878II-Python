'Please dont go here you will be robbed.Robbed twice no forced entry,spare keys taken so funny enought lost deposit to rude untrustworthy staff who wanted 90 euros for new key to be cut,who do thet think they are kidding.This place is not safe,every hood on the streets must have a key for these apartments.Have my opinion was a inside job,please dont let these people con you like they did us.Place is disgusting, safe outside with washing machine which by the way the so called reception downstairs says is not covered if it is broken into.That on its own should tell you enough.Tour operators should be ashamed to have this place even mentioned.please once again dont go here.April 2012.
