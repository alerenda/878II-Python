'The "hotel" is disgusting. The price is very expensive. Everything is dirty, they didn't clean my room in the 4 days I was there. The air conditioning was all day long working even if it was march and the on/off button was broken and there wasn't remote controler. The shower wasn't working and they didn't pay attention to my complains. The walls are so thin you can listen to everything. The worse thing is the staff there. The one staying at night insulted me so badly and he didn't even understand english. If I were you I'd try to stay in another hotel or even better a hostel or bed and breakfast, but Mondial is the worse place I've ever been and I've travelled all around Europe.'
