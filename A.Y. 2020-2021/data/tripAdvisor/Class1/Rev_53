'Having stayed in same hotel chain but in Cancun, we decided to stay in Playa but Never again. After making arragements with other friend family, pricing was almost double next day. Maybe reasonable because of the high season, but that was just the beginning of a bad experience. We arrive late around 11 pm tired of a busy day and the recepcionist could not find the reservation, there were other guests complaining about the key card not working and no WiFi, so No Internet connection available. Once arriving at the room we were hungry and decided for a pizza since the hotel has no restaurant, we called front desk to get a telephone number and they said no restaurant would serve us after 11 pm. I took the local phone book and ordered the pizza and it was on my room in less than 30 minutes, while dinning a bell boy knock at the door to bring the lugagge but from other room. No matter what temperature we choose from air conditioning, it was freezing anyway. Then when preparing to go to bed we want to believe that sheets were only not ironed and not dirty, also noticed that the the sink was clogged, we decided not reporting it because we all were tired, but past midnight again they knocked at our door and when going to open, a maid was already opening our door!!! she said she was checking if our room was available??? Next morning breakfast, the space is to small to attend so many guests with a simple continental, coffe, bread, ham, butter, jam and some fruit, the toasters not working so everybody taking care of not burning the bread. One good thing of this hotel is that they are very punctual, when they say breakfast is served until 11 am, at 11:01 all food disappeared as if by magic. The best is that we stayed there only one night. Room Tip: Not at this hotel, reserve elsewhere. See more room tips'
