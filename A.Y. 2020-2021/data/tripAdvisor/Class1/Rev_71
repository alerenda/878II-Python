'On arrival we had to pay a 50 euro deposit. This was not mentioned when booking the holiday and it had to be cash. We were on a strict budget so this was a nightmare. The apartment itself was dirty, hairs on the toilet, and bedding. There were 2 sheets on each bed, only the top one had been changed when we arrived, the bottom sheet was stained. The bath was filthy and the apartment was riddled with ants. When we complained about the ants, a maid came to the room, swept the floor and left. The staff are extremely rude and unhelpful. There was very little entertainment over the 10 days. On one night there was a 'disco' which consisted of a few people eating dinner with music channels on 2 televisions. I asked the waiter where the disco was and he said, if i don't like the disco then we could go back to my apartment together! My boyfriend then returned from the toilet and we left. Very disappointing, dirty, rude staff!!'
