'The hotel was dirty, Unfortunately I had to venture behind the night stand to plug in an appliance. Behind the stand I found several disgusting things, there were several very large clipped toenails greeting me along with moldy food and wrappers. This really was very upsetting and disgusting. The plug was broken and was an electrical hazard as well. The furniture was very well used. Also the rooms air conditioner blew on the bed closest to the unit and made it very uncomfortable. We also were upset about some conflicting information from the desk clerk. We had requested a late check out 4PM on Sunday, the clerk quoted us $29.00. Come the day of checkout we went to the desk and were charged $39.00 as I reviewed my. I disputed charge and was told the I had been misinformed by the night clerk and that the $29.00 was for checking out at 2PM. I asked for a refund and the clerk stated that she would bring it up to the manager for action. Have not heard a work or my $10.00 refund since! No laundry facilities.
