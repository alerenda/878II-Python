'We stayed the June 24th- June 28th 2012. Check in starts at 4 p.m. Got there exactly at 4 and waited about 20 minutes not bad at all. The front desk staff was very personable and friendly, along with the maids and security. Overall I felt very safe in the hotel. The first thing we noticed was how smokey the whole casino is. Very very smoky The second thing we noticed was how dirty/unmaintained everything was. A lot of the emergency exit signs were not turned on in the casino and on our floor, which was floor 8 in the mardi gras tower. One noticeably in the casino was full of dust. It was absolutely disgusting. The carpet on the 8th floor was horribly wrinkled. The room was outdated, older tv and such we could live with that, we were there just to sleep anyway. The bed was very comfortable. The thing that got us was the places that the maids obviously overlook. Behind the bed was soo dusty, there were cobwebs on the ceilings/etc.'
