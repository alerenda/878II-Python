'We showed up and they didn't even have our reservation correct. On top of that, the front desk staff were incredibly rude and were not helpful at all!!! We reserved a deluxe room with a view and there was nothing deluxe about it! The bathroom was small, the a/c was noisy, there was no view whatsoever, and the beds were extremely uncomfortable! I will never recommend this hotel to anyone or stay there ever again!'
