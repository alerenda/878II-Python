'I hate to write a bad review, but I know a ripoff when I see one, and this my friends is a complete and total RIPOFF!!!!!!!! I believe, THE GOOD REVIEWS ARE WRITTEN BY THE OWNERS AND THEIR FRIENDS/FAMILY. My family and I were excited to have a nice little get away. When we saw pictures of the Villas Marlin, we were sold! The rooms looked really nice and clean and a lot of the reviews made us trust we were going to the right place. When we arrived, we were stunned! Please note** We are by no means "hoytie toytie" or snobby, but this place is a complete disaster/dump! For starters, as soon as we walked into the room, we were greeted by intense humidity that was the equivalent of a sauna. As we walked through the rooms, nothing looked like it had been cleaned or updated in quite some time! There were stains all over the bed spreads, the closet door was ripped off the hinges, electrical wires hanging out of the walls in the closets, the back of the toilet was duct tapped back together. The sheets and towels were old and worn out, some with holes. Nothing looked like it had been cleaned, the kitchen counter tops were infested with bugs, if you looked closely at the floor, the bugs were all over the floors as well. When we walked out to our "beach view" we were distracted by a dirty roof with a huge air conditioning unit that was sitting right in front of us. We brought dinner back and ate before looking for a hotel as the condition of this place would ruin a long awaited vacation, (IT WAS THAT BAD)!!!!. When we got back to the table, around 10-15 minutes later, bugs were all over our food and in our drinks. That was the last straw for us, as we packed up our belongings and left for a hotel, which turned out to be the best decision we ever made!!!!!'
