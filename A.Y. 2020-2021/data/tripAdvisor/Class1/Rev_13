'I booked the hotel for a two night stay as a stop-over on the way back from holiday so my son could take in the Paris sights. The photo on the web was of the reception area which, in fairness was nicely decorated. However, our room was nowhere near as good. The flooring was warped with joints overlapping (badly fitted) and was plain dirty in places. The beds were dirty, though we had clean sheets. The bathroom was also bad - the shower unit was dirty with mould and the shower head was broken so that it leaked and would not stay in the holder. The hotel may be under renovation, but it needs to be done properly before I would even consider staying there again. Found Le Mistral (bistro around the corner) to be superb for food and drink though...'
