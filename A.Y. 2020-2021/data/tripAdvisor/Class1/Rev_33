'Here the people from the hotel seem to do the only very necessary things. It was raining in my bed and nobody was really worried about it. I woke up sick, unfortunately I was so tired that I did not realize my wet bed. The staff follows its own agenda and timetable, we could not feel something like hospitality or caring forthe client. As I wished to get hot water because I felt so sick, I had to wait until the formal restaurant opened although the receptionist was enjoying a hot coffee in front of me. The towels are very dirty, although being washed, not really appealing to use them. In the evening we could not order a second drink as the stuff was closing down and wanted to go home. In the morning the other way around, you have to wait until they are ready to serve. The beach is nice, but you cannot swim there. Too many algae. Other members of our groups had either no water in the shower, or no water in the toilet.'
