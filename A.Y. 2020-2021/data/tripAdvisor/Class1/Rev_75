'This hotel is worth what you pay. It was extremely reasonable. We got it though a package deal from a 3rd party website. It is nice that it is all inclusive, but it is nothing compared to some of the other ones in Cancun. The hotel staff are very pushy and just want your money. They are not customer service oriented at all. The building was literally falling apart in places and the "gym" has just been a construction site for months apparently. The food is ok. Nothing special, but plenty to fill you up. The drinks aren't bad and when you get to know the bartenders it makes all of the difference in the world. A dollar or two goes a long way in a tip! The rooms are spacious, but very dirty. I can't even explain the nasty smell coming from our couch. We were upgraded, but our door was broken. Our key never worked. The first night they completely took our door apart and worked on it for hours until it was "fixed." On the bright side, the beach is amazing and makes up for the other flaws. The pool area is clean and nice. There are fun games daily like bingo and water volleyball. At night they have fun activities too to keep you busy. The Mediterranean restaurant is worth it, but you have to make reservations in the morning to go. It is better than the buffet food. Overall, I wish I would have spent a little bit more money for a nice hotel. It was worth the price though, so I can't complain. Having never been there, it wasn't bad. The beautiful beach and wonderful weather makes everything better. You live and learn, and I learned to spend the extra money for something a little extra. Room Tip: Just ask for an upgrade. We did and they gave us a junoir suite. Also try asking for a beach view in... See more room tips'
