'My luggage was delayed after flying into Cancun and I needed a hotel in Cancun quickly. I picked this out of the guidebook so that we could get to the beach! The hostel is actually in an old mall. It means the things are a bit awkward by times. There is no main sitting/relaxing area. Pros: One of the only hostels in the hotel zone of Cancun, affordable for the hotel zone, computers available for use, free continental breakfast (basic but free) Cons: Things were a bit musty and not super clean, we found a old shirt in a random dresser. Overall consensus, its not really a great place, but if you want to be in the hotel zone without paying resort prices you can crash here for a night or two.'
