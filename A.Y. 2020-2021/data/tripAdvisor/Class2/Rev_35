'Hotel location is good as it's actually about 10mins walk (slightly downhill) to Wesceslas Square so in a good position. Upon entry, it is a nice hotel with a small reception area and the staff were always very helpful and friendly. However our room at the front of the building was Very dated, and could have done with a new coat of paint as the walls were white with a lot of scuff marks and foot prints on them... the room also had quite a few cobwebs which caught me by surprise... the curtians and carpet had seen much better days as they were grubby with stains. Beds were Rock Hard, probably the hardest I have ever slept in with flat pillows but the bedlinen was clean as was the bathroom. There is no wardrobe as such and just a hanging shelf upon entry to the room where you could hang some of your clothes. We went in December and it was freezing outside but the room was always warm. As I went to Prague with my friend for a girly weekend, the room did the job and we didn't mind as we didn't really spend too much time there as we were out quite alot, however if I was travelling with my husband then unfortunately I would have to choose another hotel. If your looking for accommodation close to the square, that is cheap and don't really mind where you stay then this is the hotel for you.'
