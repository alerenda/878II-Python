'this is not the place for you! I'm not gonna lie - this is one heinous little hole in the wall. But, if you are on a shoestring budget, consider it. This is a good place to stay if you are young, have little money, and plan to spend your day visiting the sites OUTSIDE the room. I stayed here back in 2009 with a friend when I was doing a bit of traveling after my master's degree. The two men who work the front desk were very accommodating and friendly. They even let my friend and I behind the desk to check our email on their computer, and invited us into the kitchen for a drink. The room was fine - it didn't have all the perks of modern hotels, but it had a large window with a balcony and a nice view of the street below. There was a tv, but I don't think it ever worked. But, we weren't there to watch soaps... It was a fairly safe area (despite being asked by a fellow boarder if I was a hooker), and close to the metro and a grocery store. I would recommend to those not looking for any fluff, just a place to rest their head at night after a long day of siteseeing. Room Tip: I really don't think there are that many rooms to pick from.
