'We Booked a stay for a week at the Carisa Y Palma Condo's in Cancun as it was advertised on e-bay by tortuga420. We wanted a cheap place to lay our heads in Cancun, no frills just a base from which to explore the region. As such we had very low expectations. What we did not bargain for however was the overall unsafe condition of the condo which we rented! It had no lock on the balcony door and my other half got a nasty electric shock from the stainless steel cooker and sink unit! On top of this hardly any of the lights worked and the airconditioning unit was so loud, the loudest I have ever heard which made it unuseable. I would not recommend this place to anyone, even after receiving a nasty electric shock and checking out of the accomodation for fear of our personal safety after just 3 days of our 7 day vacation, the owner of the condo would not give us a refund and became very confrontational. The location of the condo is generally good for young people who want to be near all the clubs but with this comes the constant hassle as you walk down the street from promotional people offering everything from food to taxi and other less desirable merchandise, if you catch my drift! I cannot stress enough that we beleived that the unit had not been properly maintained and was DANGEROUS!'
