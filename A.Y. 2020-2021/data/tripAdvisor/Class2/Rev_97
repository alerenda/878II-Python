'never again if that is what they call the [jamaica experience] stayed at the breezes hotel trelawny, we found out that they were closing a few days after we were leaving, and thomas cook reassured us that it would be the same service, was it hell,why they were putting people at this hotel is beyond me. the first room we had the bathroom was dirty, so they moved us to another, lightbulbs in one of the lamps kept blowing up and it was not reassuring to see a a hole in the wall with the electrical wires coming out of it where your head is lying on the pillow, the person who arrived to change the bulb told us it was overload on the electrical system this made us feel a lot better....not. during the night my hubby got up from bed to get a drink of water and as he went to open the fridge door the replacement bulb blew up,the door caught his foot and the rusted bottom took the skin off,hence daily trips to the nurse everyday for treatment, he was told by the nurse to stay out of the pools as they had germs in them,we already knew that as the pools were dirty and i would as being a nurse myself say they were a health hazard, then the police convention arrived utter chaos also arrived you could hardly get near a bar for them and if you used the dining area there was no plates available or cups just great when you have saved all year to go on holiday and you cannot get a plate to eat off that was if there was any food left. the 2nd week we were there the day passes came in they had stopped them during the police convention, again they were running out of plates and cups and glasses and again sometimes no food left we had a child with us and her mother was made to wait 20 minutes to be seated whilst the day passes were just walking in and taking a seat and wait for it nothing much for the child to eat the manager said there was a food station for children we had not seen one so she sent for the chef who proceeded to tell her there was no food station, we were then told it was staff sabotage.. eh.... excuse me we were on holiday and thomas cook assured us there would be no problems and then the thomas cook rep got worried because he had a planeload of canadians coming in next day and to cap it all we were getting approached for our bands seemingly day passes were being given to other locals so they were coming in and had not paid a penny towards food, they also told us staff and security also knew about this scam...so hey folks your money helped feed a good few others so if that was the jamaican dream holiday you can keep it, one last thing to say....THOMAS COOK YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE SENT YOUR CLIENTS HERE AND YOU SHOULD BE REFUNDING THEM THEIR MONEY.'
