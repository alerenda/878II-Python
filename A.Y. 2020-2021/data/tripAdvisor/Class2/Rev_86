'I am by no means classed as a snob and i have stayed in both hostels and five star hotels and to me hotels are about the atmosphere and experience and this place really didn't have much going for it. I went with low expectations and this was just a base so we could travel to barcelona. The room itself was alright very spacious but very outdated. The worst thing were the walls, they were truly paper thin and unfortunately we were next door to the world's noisiest family but luckily we were only there for a few days. We also expected the staff to be alright due to previous reviews but they were not. The scottish lady was unhelpful and only gave us half answers and didn't seem bothered or interested. Also make sure you keep your receipt for the 50euro deposit as the man was very rude and awkward when we couldn't find it. we also paid for a safety box as we read about the robberies but be warned they are located at reception and you can't take them to your room. Blanes itself was lovely and beach was nice if a little crowded and full of topless spanish women! We found a great restaurant on the beach called cal tony loved it! We used blanes as a base for barcelona but be warned as it's an hour and half train journey away. We would stay in barcelona next time. Blanes is a nice place but we didn't like europa i'm afraid however as a base for a place to sleep it's ok and mattress is very firm but apart from that not much going for it sorry.'
