'I booked online using lastminute.com. It was advertised as a Secret Hotel, as the price is supposedly so cheap that they don't want to advertise who they are. It was over £250 for a double for two nights. When we arrived we noticed that we could have booked a superior room, rather than the standard we had been allocated, for £50 less if we had just booked direct. Coupled with the fact that we really didn't want to stay in a Holiday Inn in the first place, we felt totally misled and tricked. The staff at the hotel were not willing to compensate us or even consider moving us to a better room, even though they freely admitted there were plenty available. I don't usually complain like this but as it's Holiday Inn I don't feel guilty... I'm sure they'll be ok. Room Tip: Book direct with the hotel you are staying at... don't use lastminute.com secret hotels... See more room tips'
