'Stayed in the Apache Hostel last weekend with a friend. We were attending a music festival and wanted somewhere to leave our things and crash after a long day enjoying music. The Apache Hostel offered a good deal on a "twin dorm", so I booked it. We arrived to Dublin in the pouring rain at approx 2pm. Rang the doorbell (the doors were locked) and waited five minutes until other residents opened the door for us. Waited a further ten minutes to be served at the desk. Terrible front desk service. We paid (plus a €10 deposit which we were not informed about prior to booking) and ~again had to wait about fifteen minutes for our room to be prepared. Got up to the room and it was absolutely tiny. I'm not asking for luxury in a hostel, but surely a wardrobe or set of hangers for clothes is not too much to ask? The bathrooms were fairly clean, as were the bedsheets. But the whole building is pretty dank and dated. There are no kitchen/cooking facilities which you would assume are part-and-parcel of the hostel experience. The main selling point of the Apache Hostel is the location, which is great. Two minutes walk from the heart of Temple Bar, five minutes from Trinity, close to the Olympia Theatre and shopping areas too. But the location isn't enough to warrant staying here. I travel to Dublin frequently for music gigs, conferences, museum trips - i.e. trips where a plush room is not required - and there are a lot of cheap budget hotels (Blooms, Jurys, even Lynams on O'Connell St) which would be a far better place to stay. I will never stay in the Apache Hostel again. It just feels so grotty, the service is bad and with other hostels like Isaacs (right beside Bus Aras - where I would usually stay), I can't recommend this place when I know there are much better places to stay on offer.'
