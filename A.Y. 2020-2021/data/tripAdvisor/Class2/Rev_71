'I stayed at the hotel only one night. I wanted to try what a 3 star all inclusive can offer. Not much. The food is terrible, the selection is forgettable. The beach bar does not function, although I was told that the hotel is full. The rooms are cathastrophic, no AC remote, no TV remote. The standard room even does not have a safe, just an iron box with a 30 years old lock. I complained and asked for a room change, then a superior room was offered to me, that was a bit better (real safe box), but the new room was dirty, used paper in the toilet bin, half finished water next to the bed, etc. The front desk was not helpful at all, no cooperation was from their side. Next door there was a leak, a shower was leaking so loud that it disturbed me all night, couldn't sleep well. The beach is average, nothing special, yellowish sand, few people. I've seen several hotels, mostly in Cuba, but even a 3 star hotel can offer much more than this one. If you are looking for a cheap hotel in the Hotel Zone, but don't want to spend any time there, just sleeping, it might be ok. Room Tip: As I was told, there are condominiums in the hotel, you should book those ones, as these are private... See more room tips'
