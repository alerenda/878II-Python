'We arrived there after a tiring night running around trying to catch our boat to Aqaba, and after missing it "thanx to Al Jawad tours and Arab bridge maritime" two very unprofessional companies and a shame for both transportation and tourism industries in the whole region. We were booked at the Hilton Nuweiba, I have to say that I didn't used much of its facilities, but I have to say those few things: - We arrived at appx 4am (Rooms are supposedly clean) we found a welcome snack which consisted of half eaten mini sandwiches (my friends in the next room found another surprise, there was a pile of ants over the sandwiches plate). - The room decor looks olllllld (probably not renovated since the early 90's) - The bathroom floor and fittings very old as well, but seemed very clean. - Breakfast was OK, there was a large variety with a separate kids buffet. - although we didn't use any of the other facilities but there seemed to be a lot of entertainment. - The hotel turns into a ghost village at night with no lights at all. Probably if we were there on another occasion, it could've been a better experience, but certainly Nuweiba is not the place to go at all, Taba to the north is much better, and Sharm to the south is much much better. I give the hotel 3/5, and Nuweiba 0/5.'
