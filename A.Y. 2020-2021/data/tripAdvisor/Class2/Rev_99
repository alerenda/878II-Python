'Went there for the beach, with a girlfriend. Gosh.. It was my first time in a 3 stars.. Never again. The service was horrible. The staff was not helpfull, verry verry rude. Not one time in a hole week did we get a "hello how are you" Always the same food at the buffet. Electricity goes out every 2 hours for a few minutes... No hot water almost... Just terrible. Avoid this hotel at anycost. Those pple that left good reviews about this hotel were probly on the first vacation of theyre life or just had verry low expectations, maybe because a 3 star is all they can afford. Absoluetly terrible. I had a really big issu with a security guy on the beach one night and he called me a dumb [--] ! Yup! (his name was Garret)'
