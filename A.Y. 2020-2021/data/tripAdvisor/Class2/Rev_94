'This review is for Aphrodite Apartments - Further down the strip away from the beach. Some of the photos posted are from the hotel and some are from the apartments. I travelled with my friends around 2 years ago. You basically get what you pay for, simple rooms etc. The pool was nice though and there were always sunbeds free. The food was ok and the security guards certainly did their job. HOWEVER... We agreed to pay extra on our last day to keep our room later so we could get ready in it etc, as our flight was in the middle of the night. When we were packing our cases the afternoon, I realised that a pair of my Birkenstock sandles had gone missing. I was obviously very angry about this and went to question the manager about my shoes, and questioning whether the maids had taken them. They denied it but I knew they had, as we emptied all of our cases to check they hadn't got mixed up. We went out that night and left our cases in reception. When we got back to wait for the bus to pick us up with our cases, I decided I was cold and got my jacket out of my case... And what was packed right at the top of my case? You guessed it, my Birkenstocks were back in the top of my case. Clearly they had got them from whoever took them and put them back whilst we were out that night. Apart from that, it was ok. Zante weather is lovely.'
