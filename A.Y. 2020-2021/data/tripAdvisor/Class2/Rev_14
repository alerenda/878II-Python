'This stay follows a stay at Le Meridien Etoile where I did not have much expectations and finally got surprisingly impressed. Being used to the Westin-branch of Starwood, I knew what i could expect but was hoping for that astonishing-something i felt at Le Meridien. Needless to say, I did not. The check-in was average for this type of hotel. It took a little bit of time but I was not in a hurry anyways. Many thanks to Julie and Gergina for their help throughout the stay: their genuine service, professionalism and sincere smile are what raise the overall rate of the review. The overnight concierge is very helpful. During the day, they are just too busy with other people or on the phone, so my guess is that they are very good. Housekeeping was not top-notch. Upon arrival, I found a poncho on the floor, behind the curtains, left by the previous guest. Some areas of the room and hallway were a little bit dusty. Bottled Water was not replenished. Not a big deal. Not perfect either. The room itself is not the most spacious you will have (but hey, its Paris!) but it is nicely decorated. The breakfast room is very enjoyable but average. Overall, the Westin is not my favorite hotel in Paris, but I might come back for the location and for (some) of their staff.'
