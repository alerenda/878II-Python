'Great location for exploring Paris! Close to Gare De Lyon for getting about. The area is quiet and felt safe in the evening with some good places to eat and have a few drinks! The hotel room was good value for money, it was large enough for all four of us, with a good bathroom, plenty of storage, a safe and a fridge. However, it could have been a lot cleaner, there were hairs in the bathroom and dust and hairs all over the bedroom floor and up the stairs. The stairs were also a lttle difficult to climb with small children and luggage. We also didn't find the reception staff particulary helpful, when asking for directions we were told ' go to the centre of Paris and ask someone' Whilst the shortfalls of the Hotel did not spoil our holiday, I would not stay here again nor would I recommend this Hotel to friends and family.'
