'I stayed here for the night prior to my departure from CUN. Upon arriving at the Cancun bus station on a grueling 13 hour trip from Villahermosa, I asked the taxi driver to take me to the Hotel Bonampak. Usually I choose hotels online, but Cancun was a unique situation and I was unable to do that. He recommended instead that I go to Hotel Colonial; and then another taxista stepped in and told me of a hotel in the Zona Hotelera where I could stay for about N$700 / night. I was in! We arrive there and I am told that I was quoted the rate for the low season rather than the high season, but he could give me a room for N$900. I took it. Prior to the purchase, he showed me the room: it looked good on first sight. In particular, I was taken away by the beautiful beach view. First impressions can be deceiving... First, the air conditioning barely worked. I still think it might have been on "fan mode". Too bad, because the control panel was broken off, leaving two bare potentiometers, both immobile without pliers. This prompted me to open the doors out to the beach. Believe it or not, it was a fair amount cooler outside than in the room. I went out to an internet cafe and quesadilla vendor, and when I came back, all soft surfaces in the room - beds and all - were "caked" in a "mildew"-like moisture, and ants had invaded my bottle of strawberry-flavored water. This made it very difficult to sleep. I think I might have gotten four - maybe five - hours of sleep there? In addition, the TV only had about ten channels, one of which actually came in clearly. It lacked a remote and the "CH DOWN" button was broken off on the TV. The mirror and other objects were covered in paint, dirt, or some other substance. I definitely would not recommend this hotel to anybody, for any price - at least the room I stayed at (Habitacion N 204).'
