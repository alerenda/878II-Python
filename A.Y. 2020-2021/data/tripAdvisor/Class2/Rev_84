'This was really the worst hotel I've ever been. The room was about 4m on 1m 20, no streamingwater, no cupboard, no chair, no table, no television, just a corridor with 2 bunks, one after 2 other. The light in the room was very poor. Breakfast was only coffee, and sandwiches or toast, No milk, no cornflakes, no orange juice, help yourself , which is pretty normal, but you also have to clean your table before you can start to eat. No waiters, no personal. There is nobody in the hotel between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., only the hosts. The only thing that was clean and nice were the toilets on the corridor. I never ever go there again, what a mess for a hotel that only opened 2 months ago.... Poor us !'
