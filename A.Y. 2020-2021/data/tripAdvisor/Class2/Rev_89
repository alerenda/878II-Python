'we live in merida and when we fly out of cancun in the morning, we generally stay overnight here because of its convenient location in front of the ADO bus station and airport bus. the rooms are ok for one night. but some rooms are smelly, the place can be noisy at times - there is a pool and a restaurant on location, where you can buy breakfast, but it is overpriced. We found now another place, el rey de el caribe which is just a couple of blocks away and for the same price it is a bargain.'
