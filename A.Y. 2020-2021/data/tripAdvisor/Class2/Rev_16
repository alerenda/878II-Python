'stayed for one night. Okay hotel near city-centre, but price was to high. Our room badly needed renovation. As we locked ourselves in, we found used (hand)paper on the floor in the bathroom. Also one of two smokedetectors were sealed in plastic (probably because the cealing recently had been painted). Overcharged price for internetconnection.'
