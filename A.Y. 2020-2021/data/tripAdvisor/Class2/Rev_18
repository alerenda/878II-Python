'i am complaining with whom i booked this holiday with due to this hotel. in the wk of my stay i did not speak to one english person. i couldnt even ask a simple question, like how to book a taxi, at the reception as no one in the hotel spoke one bit of english. while going into the resturant for our meals we were constantly stared at, made to feel intimidated and uncomfortable. we felf completely out of place. we lived on salad and chips for the week as the food was horrid. we paid quite abit for this holiday more than expect and the hotel and room was not worth nearly half of it. the room was tiny the bathroom was a box. you open the door and it bangs on the b.day, you sit on the loo and have toilet roll in your face. and it wasnt the cleanest place ive stayed. so if you aint spainish stay wel clear'
