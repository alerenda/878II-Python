'It seems like the employees in this hotel gave up trying to provide good service or any service at all to their customers. even after we pointed out grievances they didn't even try to correct them and were unfriendly while doing so. the beds are hard, the ac is way to loud, the room is humid and smelly, and the breakfast has to be shared with crows which the employees did't bother to scare away. it was disgusting! After we complained about the conditions we felt like they didn't really take us serious. they were just talking spanish to each other and gave us the looks as if they were joking about us. We left after these unpleasent experiences.'
