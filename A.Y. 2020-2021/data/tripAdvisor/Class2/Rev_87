'Whose wise idea was it to build a hotel in a dis-used shopping complex? By scrimping money on air-con, the hotel is like a sauna during the day - only without the comforts. We asked for a private room. Unfortunately, their idea of private means walking through a 14 man dorm full of middle aged blokes wearing speedos to a saloon styled set of swing doors to our "oasis." the fact that the rooms did not have a real door was really something the management should have discussed before going with the budget option. The place is not even that cheap and the staff resemble Roal Dahl's Twits. Great location though'
