'The room has the few trappings of a modern hotel--crucible sinks chenille throws on the bed That's where the similarities to someplace you might want to stay ends. The rooms are a symphony of smells, largely mildew and pine sol ( which I guess is better than just mildew. That said, the hotel is noisy (as in you can hear your neighbors "enjoying" themselves through the walls). The windows could benefit from double glazing. The hallways could stand a coat of paint too. Basically the hotel was thrown up quickly and hasn't been cared for. I wouldn't stay here more than the one night I had to because of a missed connection.'
