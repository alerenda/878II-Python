'We rented a condo at Solymar for the week of April 14-20th, 2012. The condo room we rented through Airbnb was nice, but the hotel and restaurant was not. The pool(s) were ok...nothing special, but the beach was great! We didn't eat at the restaurant because we were informed that it was horrible. I did see some of the food coming out of the pool side restaurant and it didn't look good. The bus stops right outside the hotel and it's the only way to travel ($1). We would stay here again. http://www.survivalhelpcenter.com Room Tip: Rent from Michelle at Airbnb if you are going to stay at Solymar. See more room tips'
