'I booked a 3 night stay at this place primarily because of the location. The location was indeed great as it is only about a 15 minute walk to a main strip of clubs, shops and restaurants, and at $20 a night it was a bargain compared to the hotels. Other pros were the staff was nice and it had a small wildlife preserve out front that had iguanas. The main issues however were that it was not a social hostel as other guests kept to themselves and cleaning was as far as I noticed performed only once daily. Toilets got clogged a few times and the bathroom did not always smell so great. Also, the air conditioning was only on intermittently and, thus it got very hot and stuffy. Overall for me the place, while I would not call it dirty, just had a dingy and un-fresh feel to it. It's unfortunate because this hostel has so much potential. If they added a common area, bar/club hop services, and marketed the place with a fun theme, it would make the place so much more enjoyable. I'd also recommend slight upgrades to improve the interior aesthetics, more frequent cleaning, and adding deodorizers and air fresheners. After this trip I can really appreciate how much more fun a vacation can be when staying in a place where you meet people and make friends. While Hostal Mayapan was not that place it very well could be and I'd recommend the owners pursue turning it into such a place.'
