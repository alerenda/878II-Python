'While on a 4 day visit to the Catskill area a friend and I stayed here. He had booked the room. Beds were fine but pillows were either too hard or too soft. I found litter still under the bed from, I presume, other visitors. Bathroom was a little gringy, with dark spots on the shower wall and wall paper coming off the wall. The last evening we were there I killed 5 ants on the bathroom floor. Not sure where they came from. Also on the last night the Wi-Fi was down.'
