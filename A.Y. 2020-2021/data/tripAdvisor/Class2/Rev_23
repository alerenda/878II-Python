'Great location and view. I found the restaurant to be very good and ate there twice. Hotel has no real amenities and no parking, ie. parking tickets are high in Malcesine. The staff was very helpful this includes the waiters and front desk. However, my room was shabby. I could see where some would equate such with a cell. This I was very disappointed with. Overall my stay was above average. this has to do more with the location and environment than the Hotel itself. Room Tip: Do not request a single room, or go somewhere else. See more room tips'
