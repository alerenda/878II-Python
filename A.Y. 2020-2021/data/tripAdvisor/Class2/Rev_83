'Let's face it...this is no deluxe hotel. More of a choice of last resort, which in our case is the truth.We waited too long to book a reservation and the Rodeway was the only remaining option that kept us near where we needed to be. It was not, in my experience, as grim as some had indicated. This impression may be the result of my stays in hostels in Nicaragua-I've had some challenging experiences there and the Rodeway wasn't that challenging. But I can understand reviewers who are unused to travel outside of the U.S. finding many faults here. The air conditioning didn't. A used bar of soap was there to greet us in the bathtub. Wierd moldy/ black spots around the ceiling in the bath. Funky room smell. A contenential breakfast that must have it's origins in some lost (and none too appealing) continent that favors plastic wrapped muffins and sweet rolls from Sam's club. It could be worse. Seems like a family operation...but it might take more than a family to bring this place up to an average rating.'
