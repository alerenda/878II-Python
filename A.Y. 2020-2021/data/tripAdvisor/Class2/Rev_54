'I love Jandia, so we were looking forward to the holiday until we got to the hotel. The staff did not speak english very well and the directions they gave us to our room was usless, it took us a long time and much walking around to find it and then we only found it thanks to an other guest.The room was nice but awful view of a road,our bedding had black marks on it and there was a hole in the bathroom ceiling which had toilet tissue pushed in it. The food was bland and we had to keep walking around the resturant looking for a table when one was found we had to get our own cutlery and one morning we had to change the tablecloth, the tablecloths were stained and some of the dishes were broken, the staff in the resturant were rude and miserable.the entertainment was awful we went out to the british bar were we had a great time.Thank God for the beach we spent most of the day there or in the shops which are fantastic.I would never go back to that hotel again, but will go back to Jandia'
