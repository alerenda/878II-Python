'Possibly the worst hotel ever. A total Dive!! Booked a Executive room with Breakfast. The room was very basic, dated and dirty. When I asked what made this a executive room I was told because it had a window??? Got woke up at 2 in the morning by reception telling me my taxi was here. I told them I hadn't ordered a taxi and they insisted that I had. Then woke up later by the room next door partying ( wafer thin walls). breakfast is terrible. You queue for ages and then find that the food is barely edible. Location is great and that is the only plus. This hotel needs demolishing and rebuilding by a proper hotel chain. AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!
