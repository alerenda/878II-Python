'We got a cheap rate (December 11 2011) ~$60, including continental breakfast for 2 people. Positive: -Continental breakfast included (coffe, juice or fruit, bread+ spread.) -Good air conditioning, and TV with lots of channel, hot water -we were able to park right in front (free parking) -fast checkout -Elevator -room had super fast wireless *If you like Japanesse food, right across from the hotel, there is a great japanesse. We got great sushi for 100-95 pesos, tempura for 135 pesos. Great service, great quality of sushi, and the walk is a 2 min across the street. Neutral: -Check in slow. And, we were charged their "ongoing" exchange rate. *I think it was 12 or something, vs the 12.90 seen everywhere else Negative: -public computer with super slow internet and no printer -the shower was beyond old. It looked put together with cheap glue -Old blankets/towels -uncomfortable beds...but we were coming from spending all afternoon hiking and swimming at the cenotes, so we slept fine. -The shower did not "look" clean. The rest of the room looked ok. *if you are looking to save some $$ and will arrive here late in the evening and will leave early in the morning, I do recommend. If you need to be close to the downtown, turistic area, this is not a place for you.'
