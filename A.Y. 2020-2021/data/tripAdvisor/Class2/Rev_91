'Based on the good reviews we had booked a room here for a weekend in March 2012. The lady that I had called from the hotel told me it was the last one available. I guess that should have warned me. The room was on the backside of the hotel, really small and the interior without charme, no balcony and a view to a stonewall. There were holes in the bedsheets, the bathroom was old and the shower curtain had unidentifiable stains. All in all disappointing, especially for the price.'
