'Me and my friends stayed at this hotel and on the positive side I will say that the beach area is beautiful, and the staff was helpful and friendly. However the food was terrible everyday until the last night we were there it was bareable but mostly it was so bad that we ended up leaving the hotel everyday to eat other places even though the price we paid was for all inclusive. Also the hotel looks kind of old on the inside and it definitely needs to be updated. One of the days we were there our AC stopped working and water was leaking from the vent on to the floor but they did come and fix it in a timely manner. The drinks were ok and the location is not bad as there is a bus that stops directly in front of the hotel. This was out first trip to Cancun so that being said it was ok but next time I will definitely pay more and stay at a much nicer location. If you've never been to Cancun and your looking to go on a budget then this is the place but expect to get what you pay for.'
