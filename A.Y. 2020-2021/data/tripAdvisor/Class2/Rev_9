'I paid equivalent price for a private room w ensuite in the Hostel Catedral in Mexico City (USD$35) last week and while it was a smaller room & had no AC- it was much cleaner, more secure, more professionally run etc. This room is very basic and the shower is clean enough which is fine but it all feels (the bed & linen particularly) a bit skanky. The staff did give me a toilet seat (!) immediately upon request. Keen as to get out of here. Wouldn't recommend it and won't be back.'
