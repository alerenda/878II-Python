'The first thing you’ll notice is that the hotel is not easy to get to. There have been major roadworks on the roundabout just outside that have been there for an eternity and show no signs of going away, so the traffic is very heavy. If you want to use the car park, the entry and exit are very narrow and anything wider than a small family car is quite tight. The lifts are a real pain, they only have two and they have to deal with nine bedroom floors, a reception floor, a meetings floor and a car park floor; hence you often get in one and end up having to go down before you go up, or vice versa. It can easily be five minutes waiting for a lift to get to your floor at busy times. The rooms are adequate at best. My ‘kingsize’ was actually two singles put together which I spent all night falling between. The aircon is appalling, but if I opened the window it was extremely noisy and absolutely freezing. The bathrooms are fitted out with that horrible moulded plastic that stains quite easily over the years and looks dirty even if it isn’t. The bar is OK, and breakfast is fine. Staff are fine too – it’s just not a pleasant place to stay at. Room Tip: The higher the better if you want to open the window, due to the noise. See more room tips'
