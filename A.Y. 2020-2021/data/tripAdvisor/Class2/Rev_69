'I stayed here 2 previous times and really enjoyed the place. Rooms were ok and the food was pretty good. But both times i went were shoulder seasons. Well....this time i went during the winter rush. Europeans were setting there towels out at 5am to reserve chairs that they didnt sit in until noon! There just seemed to be too many people occupying this resort and there's just not enough room for all of them. The air conditioning didnt work at all...the coldest it got in the room was 78 degrees and there's no fans! The food and drinks were just as good as before but even that got old after a week. This usually is the cheapest all inclusive resort in cancun so you get what u pay for.'
