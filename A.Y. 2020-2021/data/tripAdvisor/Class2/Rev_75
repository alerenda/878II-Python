'As a group of lads going away on a stag weekend we weren't too fussy about where we booked, and for what we paid we weren't expecting The Ritz. When we arrived it took 45 minutes to get checked in because of the level bureaucracy that we were met with, along with the extremely condescending attitude of the receptionist, who turned out to carry the same attitude for the duration of our stay. At the same time we were slapped with a demand for a security deposit of €150 per room, which put a serious dent in our spending cash. Although everything in the rooms was in it's place they were very dated, a lot of the tiles on the floors and walls were broken and some electricity outlets were hanging out of the walls. The room was infested with ants and there was never enough hot water for all 3 occupants in our room, meaning that whoever went last had to be content with a cold shower. There were 4 staff members working reception during our stay, 3 of which did not give us the time of day, despite our group making the effort to be polite and courteous toward them at all times. The fourth was very polite, always spoke to us and at times shared a joke. In summary, I will never stay at this place again and with hind sight would have preferred to have paid extra to stay in a better hotel'
