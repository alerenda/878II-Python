'We found this hotel through hotwire. We have used hotwire in Canada with great success, but I would not recommend using it in Europe as the standards do not appear to be equal to those in North America. The hotel was difficult to locate as it was down a dark alleyway that I'm sure at one point, was a beautiful area. Now it is run down, dirty and full of graffiti. I will say that the staff at the hotel was exceptional. They were friendly, helpful and courteous and they did make an effort to help us when we needed assistance. The rooms, however, we not the greatest. The beds were fine - clean and comfortable, however, the washrooms were very poor. There was mold on the ceiling and the bathroom vent did not have a cover on it. We had two rooms and my mother's room had some serious water damage and the wallpaper was bubbling. It also smelled quite musty. The rooms all smelled like cigarette smoke - not ideal when you are traveling with a baby, as we were. It was obviously a hotel that appealed to school trips as there were many, MANY Spanish students running up and down the stairs and on the fire escape all night long - this resulted in quite a noisy evening. The location is great - you can walk to the shopping districts quite easily and the subway was close as well. It was most definitely NOT a three-star hotel. It's not horrible if you are looking for an affordable place to sleep, however, really not appropriate for young families or people who might suffer from allergies due to mold and second-hand smoke.
