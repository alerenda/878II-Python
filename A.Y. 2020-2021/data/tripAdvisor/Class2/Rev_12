'We stayed as two friend with a small tent and a car. We pitched our tent in the general area and parked nearby in a cordonned off area for cars. We didn't have any problems with staff, and when we made requests for information etc from reception the man behind the counter was very helpful. You can buy travel tickets from them. Main gripe is the toilet/shower block which is definitely sub-standard in comparison to many places in Europe. Toilets were badly lit and no toilet paper provided or hand dryers - I know it's camping but most places will give you that! You also had to PAY 80 cents for 5 minutes in the shower. Even to wash dishes with hot water you had to pay for it. At E23.50 a night for two people, I would expect nicer wash facilities. They did have a shop with most essentials and a bakery. There was a bar/cafe area too but we didn't brave it. Much easier to go into Amsterdam. Travel into amsterdam was very easy as the tram line stops closeby (pleasant 10 min walk though park area). But note that there is a replacement bus service part of the way into central Amsterdam all summer (until Sept 2011 I think). Total journey (tram + replacement bus) probably about 50 mins. Generally an adequate campsite but the shower block could certainly be better. Room Tip: Bring your own toilet paper! See more room tips'
