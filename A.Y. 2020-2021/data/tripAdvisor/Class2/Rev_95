'We showed up...the outside of the hotel and lobby were nice looking but the location was sketchy. The hotel pretty much shared a parking lot with a shelter and there seemed to be people hanging around the hotel parking lot. There were cameras all around the parking lot and signs saying to take all your belongings out of the car. The room had stained carpets, the toilet made horribly loud noises when flushed and the matress had springs sticking up out of it. We were not about to stay there one night. We cancelled the room and ended up paying 3x as much to go stay somewhere else but it was worth it!'
