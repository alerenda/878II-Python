'we stayed here while doing the tours at the start of our holiday and then moved to a resort at the beach for down time and to enjoy the all inclusive before coming home. this hotel was reasonably close to the bus station where we had to go everyday to catch a bus (to xcaret, chicenitza and playa del carmen, one day each) or a very cheap cab ride (20 pesos). close to some good restaurants, our favorite was La Parrilla, just two blocks away. The room was comfortable, service was fine. Breakfast ok. The only thing we didn't like was the smell coming from our bathroom sink. Sewage is very poor in cancun, and even though we closed the bathroom door we smelled it almost all the time, we should have taken a bottle of fabreeze or bought one. The floors are not very clean. For white tiles they could do a better job. We took the stairs rather than the elevator and on the first day there was a huge spill on the stairways that was never cleaned up, not even on our last day there, their white tiles are dirty. Also there is no ice machine, we had to go to a little convenience store one block away to get ours. But other than these (particularly the sweage smell) it was pretty good. We only used it to sleep and for breakfast. When we booked we thought we had the buffet breakfast, but when we got there they said our reservations only included the continental breakfast, but for an extra 100 pesos a day for a family of 3 we were allowed the buffet breakfast. So check your reservations to make sure the breakfast you want is included in your rates. We never ate at the hotel restaurant other than breakfast (which was basic) as it never looked busy.'
