'The Maldives are far away from anywhere and I guess this was quite the destination way back when rich people would fly Concorde from London to get away from it all. Today it is just a very long trip to get locked up on an island the size of an average 2 bedroom apartment. My friends and I visited for professional reason and we stayed on 3 islands in one week.

There is only one sort of fish served and they serve it in a number of ways. - Grilled, cold, head on, head off, on the side, sliced, in salad... In the end it is just the same old fish. All of the islands are staffed by very frustrated men who stay on the island on which they work for no less than 3 months at the time, go home for one week to see their women and then come back to work again. The men are home sick and hound you for tips. - Very quietly naturally but in a passive aggressive way like forcing (yes forcing) you to sit in the same spot every time you eat so to ensure you will give the server tips at the end of the week. All it takes is one person loosing his cool one day and all guests could be killed in a few minutes. There is no way to escape. But what nice it is to get away from it all, or is it?
