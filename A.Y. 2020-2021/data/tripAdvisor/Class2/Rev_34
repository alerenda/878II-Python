'This hotel should be called the "Calypso can'tcun". Everything I asked for, there was a rule why they could not provide it. First of all, to be slightly positive, the room was fairly clean (if you ignore the small bugs near the sinks). Maid service was fine. The concierge was VERY helpful (even translating for me with the other hotel workers). The location was ok, right across the street from the Embarcadero - the ferry to Isla Mujeres. But to get to a beach, you have to go through the hotel across the street. Views were ok. Ride to downtown on a bus or taxi was only a couple minutes. So here's why it is the hotel can'tcun: Can't sleep late in the morning because of the loud birds. Can't sit at the pool area without the ants all over your shoes and table. Can't receive phone calls in the room - phone broken. Can't receive a visitor in room without signing a notice saying I allowed them into my room. Can't change your American $ into pesos because we ran out. Can't change that American bill because it is slightly ripped. Can't walk by your room without seeing a newt on the wall. Can't put things near the sink - there are small bugs near it. Can't get into the shower without creating a large puddle in the bathroom since the shower door opens INTO the shower spray. The front desk people were nice, but not helpful. As I checked in, the gentleman wanted a credit card for me to pay. Even though I assured him several times that it was already paid for through Orbitz. I would NOT stay here again. There are so many other nice hotels in Cancun. Room Tip: Ask for the street side - otherwise you get the lagoon side - nice, but not the same view. See more room tips'
