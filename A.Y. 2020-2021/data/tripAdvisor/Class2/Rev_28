'The guesthouse is located not to far from Union Street and is certainly not the most expensive in the area. However, the location cannot compensate for the lack of comfort and cleanliness. We stayed there for three nights in November and it was quite cold outside and inside. When we the tried to turn on the heating in our rooms, the inside temperature did not change. Clearly, the landladies were trying to save some money on their heating bill. The beds withing the rooms are quite small and certainly anything but comfortable. If you turn around in your sleep, the bed's squeaking will make sure that you will wake up. The landladies also have dog, which are allowed to run free around the guest house, when they think nobody is in the flat. The dogs also explain the unpleasant wet-dog small that is present in the whole guest house. Altogether, I would not recommend anyone to stay in this guesthouse unless they have no other options.'
