'I should have heeded the reviews before booking. The stories posted about no hot water were all too true. The evident lack of maintenance in the room and the fact that the door lock did not work properly would not have been so notorious had it not been for the fact that we had no hot water at all during the two nights we spent in this very old hotel. "Old" as in "run down". On our second day a technician finally showed up, but only to get hot water in ONE room, 3 stories below ours. I asked the man at the front desk if we could move in there, but he emphatically said "no" because all the other guests were using that same room to shower. Yes, the view from the balcony on to the lagoon was great, but this is definitely not the place for you unless you don't mind lying on a bed next to a time-worn sink whose missing doors give you a full view of a rusty drainpipe. This is not the first time I stay in a budget hotel, but this is the first time I see so much lack of interest to keep a hotel functional. One half of the entire facility without hot water? Mom, Dad, please don't bring your family here. Room Tip: Ask first if the hot water system is functional for the room you're booking. See more room tips'
