'The place we got directed to which was 'Hostal Marpez' according to the address was a chained shut property with overgrown shubbery all over it. We could get in because it was locked and all the lights were off. after 10 minutes of calling 'Ola!' we eventually were met by the owner who spoke no English. he took us up to the kitchen lounge area and left us waiting in the dark fro 10 minutes before coming straight back up and asking for money. The whole place seemed really creepy and we left asap. Atmosphere was terrible and we weren't convinced anyone else was staying there!'
