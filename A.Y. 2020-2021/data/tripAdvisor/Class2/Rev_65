'I stayed in Hatters for two nights a month ago (solo female traveller). I stayed in the big dorm, which I have done in many hostels in europe. A week after being home my legs came up in horrible welts, I had no idea what they were, and after some google searching they were definately bed bug bites. They were in lines of three like bed bugs are and people usually take 5- 14 days to react. I have read lots of reveiws for places where people say there are bed bugs but never take much notice of it - I sure will now! They were so painful and horrible looking. I have emailed them and they said they will fumigate, however no reply on a refund to pay for some of the cost of antihistamines and fumigation I had to do in my house! Room: This one was particularly cramped, hardly room to walk between the bunks, and extremely loud from street noise, as well as very light from the street lights as the blinds didnt work. Bathrooms: The bathooms were extremely cold. The showers were little cubicles with a bit of frosting on the glass, and you had to leave your things on a bench a few steps away from the showers, so it was almost impossible to shower without other girls seeing you naked. The other problem with the shower was that it was like the taps on a timer, my shower lasted exactly 8 seconds before you had to push it again - makes washing your hair take forever! Luckily the next time I showered I found one that lasted more like 15 seconds. Overall: Overall I had thought that these were typical problems of hostels, and I had not too many complaints (before the bites showed up), although this one was quite expensive compared to many I have stayed in. It was also close to everything and the staff were very friendly. But honestly I would have chosen somewhere else to stay if I went there again (even before the bites).'
