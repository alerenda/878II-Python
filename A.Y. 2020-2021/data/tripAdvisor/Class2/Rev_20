'This hotel has the most amazing position on the seafront with stunning views through glazed balconies over the activities in Palma Nova Bay. It is let down by poor air conditioning,declining food standards and a general air of decadence. The rooms are a fair size but ned refurbished and the TVs are ancient. The seaview supplement is quite high but certainly worth it.'
