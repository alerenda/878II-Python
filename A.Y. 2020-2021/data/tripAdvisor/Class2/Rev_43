'We arrived and checked in, as we saw the room we decided to leave, they cheraged us 2 nights instead of one night as described in the voucher booked direct in their website, so they were not fair enough to even garantee what their own website says, I tried to revert and get this one night back in the credit card but no answer was given to us, I feel that I was stolen by this hotel, very simple and with a website that do not retract the trully about their facilities.'
