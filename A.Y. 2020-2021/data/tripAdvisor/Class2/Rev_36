'We stayed there from 12/23/2011 through 12/29/2011 paying $165 per day. The room 307C was one of the worst room with no view at all. If you plan to stay there, please don't stay in any C room. The hotel does not have any good restaurant, coffee shops, bar etc. The beach is non swimmable and it might be one of the worst hotel in the hotel zone in Cancun. Room Tip: Any room other than C rooms. never 307C See more room tips'
