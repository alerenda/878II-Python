'Urine smell was evident. If you are to up to this type of odor when you wake up, good luck.I was misled by the reviews here and came very disappointed. We asked the maids to clean with ammonia everyday, but it did not help much. We were told all bathrooms were the same and they needed it to let the water out when cleaning the floors. There were other issues but we think is important for new customers to be beware of this fact. Needless to say that we asked to switch rooms, but we were told there were no rooms available despite the early arrival. Other clients were asking to change rooms as well. The concierge people were there to sell us the next door hotel package so beware of this as well. The Flamingo mall is mostly empty. Try the Isla Mall, you'll love the difference.'
