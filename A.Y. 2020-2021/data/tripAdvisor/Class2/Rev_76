'Two very best girlfriends - between 22-25 years old - we booked in october '11 for four nights. We reccomend you, this hotel, if you want to feel as you are in a fancy-modern-expensive hotel , next to the beach and next to the exuberant nightlife ! -Location : excellent ! 5 minutes walking from the beach, between spanish and english partyzone :D next to bus-station. -Rooms : modern, big and nice (with quite oke terrace) . With modern bathroom , BUT unfortunately not the cleanest ! -Swimming pool : clean with a nice terrace and cocktail bar. (in october) you should use in the morning, if you wanna enjoy the sunshine with it. -Stuff : friendly . -Restaurant : modern, with a large variant of food ( the food quality was poor ) . suggestion : book just for the breakfast and enjoy it on the terrace - surrounded by palm trees (that's beautifull) Enjoy it ;) Room Tip: book for a sea-view room (ex.: 607 - VI. floor) See more room tips'
