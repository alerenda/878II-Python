'Negative: When I read some comments saying "noise/loud place" ...I could not imagine that I could really dance in my room like in a discotheque. The discos are on the other side of the road, but from the rooms of the hotels (laguna side) you can hear the music all night, keeping the window closed ....and it's really loud indeed....Maybe windows are too thins. The room in general is basic but not very clean. Our sheets were stained, the couch full of dust and the sink completely stuck Positive: the stuff was very friendly and help us to change the room at night, giving us another one on the sea-side (much less noise). For this change, we had to pay 26 dollars more per night but...At least we could sleep. Location is excellent if you want to party (exactly in the middle of discos, bars, etc) and the beach is amazing.'
