'I booked this hotel as a last minute thing. I needed to be in Paris the following week so was pleasantly surprised when a room was free in the centre of Paris near my intended destination. Unfortunately it was all down hill from there. The hotel was down a small alley way. Shady characters hanging around from 8pm onwards was a common theme and the hotel was the size of a shoe box. The room I had (on the first floor) overlooked the shady street and a good nights sleep was pretty hard to get unless you liked sleeping next to a bunch of people shouting. The one night I did manage to sleep, I woke up to find my laptop and phone missing. Someone had come into my room, while I was sleeping, and robbed me. The hotel staff were beyond useless. Other notes: One night the sheets had a nice wet patch - no idea what that was Wireless was worse that dial up Shower is so small, if you move, you risk switch the shower to cold Air-con doesn't work TV didn't work DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL. Room Tip: Stay at the Holiday Inn around the corner. See more room tips'
