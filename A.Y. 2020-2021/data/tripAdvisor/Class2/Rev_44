'We stayed for 3 days at this place. It is in the heart of the Cacun's most happening club area, a block away from the party street where all the clubs are. The rooms were nice and the pool area and the restaurant was great. My only concern with this place was they do not change the bath towels or linens for 3 days of your stay. You need to pay extra if you needed fresh towels everyday. Com'on you are in Mexico where its cheap and this hotel isn't dirt cheap, yes i give it to the location but pay for fresh towels everyday, they must be kidding right!! We were super annoyed when they charged us for a small stain on the pillow cover which can easily be washed away. Another concern that we had was the wireless doesnt work in the room and they claim it works in the pool and lobby area. But for the 3 days we stayed it never worked and we had to pay to use the computer in the lobby area. It was like 1 peso per min but com'mon they are supposed to mention that while you are booking. well, looks like this is how they make money in Mexico.'
