'I have been there in April while visiting Koikenhof. Advantages: I really liked breakfast, tasty and rich.Fruit salad with melon, mango, orange with sour cream was the best (in the morning tasted perfectly). There were a lot of people there during the breakfast but everyone found the place to seat and enjoy breakfast. Disadvantages : 1) far from the center 2) Price ( for me two nights in Poland in *** hotel cost the same as 1 night in Tulip Inn) 3) It really needs renovation and all that shown on the photos is true. Conclusion: I think that it is possible to find better hotel for the same price'
