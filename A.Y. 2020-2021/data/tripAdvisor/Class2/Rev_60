'We booked the Bermudas for a cheap get away in February. We paid just over £16 a night so were not expecting the Ritz but we were disappointed. The room we were given was dirty and shabby. The bathroom tiles were covered in mould, the sink was dirty and the curtains were threadbare and torn. The room smelled musty. The built in wardrobes had peeling paint and mould inside. We told the receptionist that the room was not acceptable and we were moved to another which had been "refurbished". The new room was basic but generally clean although the crockery and cutlery had not been washed, the knives and forks had been used and just put back in the drawer. The towels were changed daily however and the linen changed every other day. It's a shame they didn't check the cupboards. We ate out and didn,t use the cooking facilities at all. Overall the place was tired and shabby and on reflection we wouldn't go again.'
