'We found an individual condo rental on a vacation rental website. While disappointed with the decor and cleanliness of the condo itself (stayed in unit G-4) along with no hot water for 2 days in our unit, the building was perfect. We had security 24/7 and that was important for a girls weekend. Also they were so friendly. The pool area is hardly used so we had a spacious infinity pool most of the time all to ourselves. The security guys would put out lounge chair pads for us, bring over tables for our drinks, and were so friendly. I can not say enough about the staff here. We set our beach bags out by the pool and then went for a walk on the beach and got caught in the rain. The security guy moved our bags into his office near the beach entrance gate so that they would be dry. I was so impressed with them! The condo is also perfectly located to a wide variety of things including a ton of clubs - Dady O, Coco, Coco Bongo, etc. Starbucks is right across the street along with an Oxxo store to get some basic drinks and snacks. Also the there's a ferry pick-up right next door near Macambo that takes you over to Isla Mujeres for a day trip for $17 round-trip. There is not much beach space here or at the neighboring hotels and the water can be rough on some days. But with the beautiful pool, spa, gym and hot tub, we didn't miss it. Great view, great staff, and a very clean building. Room Tip: Most rooms are easy to access since they have individual entrances and stairs/elevators. See more room tips'
