'Came here with my friend and really had no idea what the place might be like. My friend booked the whole trip. It seemed ok upon arrival, until the guy at the frint desk asked us if we wanted to upgrade our room to an ocean view package, showed us the package and picture of the room and said it would be an extra $90 for the week. We said sure would love it. The picture said it came with a fridge that was stocked daily with water and pop and some beers. When we were brought to the room, the room looked nothing like the pic and there was no fridge....we called down and complained to guy at front desk and he said oh no, we got what we paid for and became very difficult with us. We stayed in the room, but there was no fridge, no water and it was just a plain old basic room. The AC sucked. The service sucked at every bar in the place, they refused to fill up your thermos. Drinks were watered down. food was the worst i have ever experienced anywhere and i have been to Cuba twice and found there food decent compared to this SLOP! Entertainment at the pool was NOTHING! I would never stay here again, you couldnt pay me enough to stay here, run far away from this palce if your considering it!! Customer service really needs to be worked on. Great location, this place could be a good hotel if they put some money into it and trained their staff properly!!'
