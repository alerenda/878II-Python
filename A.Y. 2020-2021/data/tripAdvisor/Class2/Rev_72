'To be honest I was really disappointed with my stay at the Marais house. The location is fantastic since it is very central and on a beautiful quiet street. I feel the house would of been amazing once but it now lacks luster and has become very dark and dusty. The owner was a lovely man to welcomed us into his home and told us a great restaurant however that was about it. The rooms although large are not clean and the whole house was freezing. Unfortunatly we had to leave after one night since it wasn't what we were expecting- and definetly overpriced for 300 euros a night.'
