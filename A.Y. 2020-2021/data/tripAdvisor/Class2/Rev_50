'I have never written a review before but I stayed at the great parnassus jan 22nd thru 26th and it was the worst experience ive ever had so I felt it was my duty to warn people. I booked through apple vacations who told me the resort was just as nice as the sold out golden parnassus. The resort was absolutely awful. The staff were rude and unhelpful as well as the apple reps. There was a cockroach on the wall and a hair in my food the first day. We also had to argue for 3 hours to get a key for the safe. It was completely ridiculous. We were finally moved on the 4 th day when we found a maggot in a grapefruit. Do not stay here, it has no comparisons with the golden which is an amazing resort.
