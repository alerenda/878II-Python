'The pool is beautiful but there is no sun after 2 pm due to the hotel being built next door. A staff member damaged our personal property and the "manager " blamed us for it, that is after a dozen phone calls and him passing the incident to an assistant manger. One more thing, apparently a dignitary arrived in the suite next to us the day after we got there. We spent the entire stay with security guards holding machine guns outside of our room the entire time. We were there on our honeymoon 10 years earlier and had the best time ever. I guess you can't go back.'
