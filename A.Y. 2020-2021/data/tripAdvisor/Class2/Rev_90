'I had stayed at this hotel about 4 years ago and was so charmed by it so I was excited to be going back in May. I cannot tell you how disappointed I was when I was given a room that you would not have seen in a 1 star hotel. The wall and carpet were patched and filthy and the room had a very stale smell. When I asked the manager to come up and have a look at the room, he proceeded to tell me that he had never been in this particular room but next time I should ask for a renovated room. Be WARNED, there are not enough renovated rooms to go around and at 400 euros a night it is the biggest rip off in Rome. I will never stay there again! Room Tip: Ask for renovated!!!
