'Seriously people, I could write a long drawn out story about my stay here but let's just chalk it up to this: -The staff was horrible. Service was terrible. Asked for something on the phone and it took 3 hours and several phone calls to finally get some bed sheets that were missing from my bed. -The rooms were a nightmare! Had to change rooms several times due to air conditioning not working and each room had a nasty mildew odour. Never got a room with working air conditioning. I just gave up. I'm not a picky person either. By the second last day of our trip we realized that our room was infested with tiny ants that we didn't notice before. We were covered with little bites so we looked around the room and found them all over the place. -The food was mediocre. The a la carte restaurants were not good except for the Bbq. That one was ok. For the money that you pay for the trip I would suggest spending a couple of hundred bucks more and going to a nicer resort. Your overall experience will be way better. Trust me! Room Tip: Just pick a different resort. See more room tips'
