'I have been staying here for about 6 weeks now and though there are some serious frustrations it's not nearly as bad as some of the reviews I've read. The rooms are small and dated. They are not dirty or disgusting but not as clean as they could be. They are refurbishing the exterior right now but honestly they should have started with the rooms first. The windows don't latch properly so ventilation is a bit of an issue for me. I'm not a smoker but the smell from nearby rooms kind of invades my space. It's not like some have said, living in an ashtray, but it is unpleasant. The furniture is well worn and not that comfortable and the bathtub is a bit rusted. The utensils are meager at best and the breakfast is honestly a joke. They have coffee that constantly runs out, some really unappetizing apples and oranges and bagels and muffins that are most likely from the day old section. All and all you get what you pay for. The price is ok and the facility is most definitely better than some of the other weekly or monthly rentals I checked out. The staff is mostly friendly but don't do much to correct the issues you need help with. I feel relatively safe in the location and there are several businesses within walking distance. Basically, if you go in knowing what to expect you shouldn't be too disappointed. If you need to save a few bucks than it's worth the stay.'
