'when we arrived in benidorm on the 18th august and the coach pulled up just around the corner from the estudios i actually thought he was joking, i thought any minute now Jeremey Beadle is going to come from around the corner and say only joking this isnt yours really. the rooms where small and not much room to swing a cat. they are in need of a good revamp considering it wasnt cheap to stay there for 5 nights, anylonger i think i would have slept on the beach, i found some of the staff rude, the only area that was nice was the reception area. there was holes in the wall, wires lose in the kitchen by the door, cracked walls cracked ceilings. this was my first time in benidorm, the only thing nice about the room was the comfy beds and air conditioning,we made it enjoyable as it was my friends 40th,'
