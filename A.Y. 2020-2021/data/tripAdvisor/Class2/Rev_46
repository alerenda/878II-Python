'The hotel itself is actually ok - their "restaurant" is a total disaster, breakfast is ok though... The hotel has almost no english speaking staff which makes it even worse when (as we) one gets stuff stolen by the staff... The Hotel has no deposit boxes, and therefore everything you bring is at your own risk, and is not ensured... We always take all aour values with us on a backpack - we always have, and have never gotten stolen from before - not even in India... Here - the first time we ever left our room without out backpack was on departure day, we were gone for less than one hour... in that time the room had been Cleaned, or actually only a small part of it, including a part of my belongings, such as Iphone, headsets, pocketnife etc.. Left the hotel with a promise from the manager, who is a Texan lady that they would do what they could.. From then on, it was not possible to contact manager - she is not in hotel or just not available - front desk tells in their mex english.. i am still trying to contact manager or some day hopefully the owner of the hotel...'
