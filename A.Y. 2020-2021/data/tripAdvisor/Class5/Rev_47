'that was the best hotel i have ever seen. stayed 4 nights, breakfast, wonderful people and service, hotel was top of the list, not joking!!!! will never forget the breakfast, dinner, quiet, garden, swimming pool, friendly people and beautiful landscape. it is a must if you like a quiet, restful place where man can really think about what life is. give it a chance, you will enjoy it. the only problem is you need a car and good directions. Still i give my compliments to the owner and the personnel. wonderful job and i loved it. The American!'
