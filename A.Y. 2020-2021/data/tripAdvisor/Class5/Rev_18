'mayafair is a very good hotel, clean and really cheap. the service was excellent and employees took care of everything we needed. dont stay at the hostel in the same building, it's way too expensive. for almost the same price you can stay at the hotel (you can split the costs). we were three people staying in a huge 2 bed room for about $ 23.'
