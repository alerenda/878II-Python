'I have been to this hotel twice and would reccomend it highly as although its probably not the nicest hotel in Cancun(but thats why its cheaper) the rooms are clean and cleaned regulary with free air conditioning in the rooms and very Spacious, it also has tv with lots of different channels. the hotel its self the staff make you very welcome and are polite. People moaning about this hotel will be people not understanding that for the little you pay you get more than expected from this hotel. Kevin and his team in the entertainment are amazing and really will make sure u have a great holiday and find you the best deals. All in all its a very good hotel!'
