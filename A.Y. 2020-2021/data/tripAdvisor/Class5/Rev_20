'My mother and I stayed at Casa Celeste for two nights in March 2011. The booking process was very easy. I e-mailed Marco, who responded promptly with room availabilities, prices, and directions on how to arrive using public transportation. Upon arriving at Casa Celeste, we were warmly received by Marco, who carried our bags up to our room, and his mother Celeste, who gave us her delicious limoncello. We stayed in Room 1, which had one large double bed, and also a smaller twin size bed. It was very spacious and had the most gorgeous view from its balcony, with views of the town and the sea. Some of the guidebooks recommended Room 5, which has vaulted ceilings, but it has smaller windows and no balcony (you can walk out to the roof from room 5, but you will literally be on the roof). I much preferred Room 1, which had a nice airy feel. Celeste, her husband, and her son Marco are very kind, warm, and go above and beyond the call of duty to be helfpul. It really felt like staying with family. Breakfast consisted of bread and homemade marmalade, which was delicious, as well as your choice of tea or coffee. It was admittedly a bit limited, but I think this is common for smaller hotels and bed and breakfasts in Italy. The value for money was excellent. We paid 88 euro for our room with a view, and I am told by friends who frequently visit the Amalfi coast, this is almost unheard of in Positano. Room Tip: Room 1 was fantastic! See more room tips'
