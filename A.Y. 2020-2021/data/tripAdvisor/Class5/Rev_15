'We came down to Cancun for the holidays, a romantic escape from the cold weather in Phoenix, Arizona. It was a great spot to relax and reach other locations further south like Playa del Carmen and Tulum for some scuba diving and cenotes. A family friend hooked us up with Louise (cancunlu@gmail.com) for the condo and it was really great deal. Nice clean facilities, great view of the ocean, and the beach was great for napping out on in the afternoons. Great Christmas vacation!
