'My husband and I travelled to Cyprus to get married and chose the Elysium hotel to stay in for the week surrounding the wedding - I am so glad we did! Everything about the hotel is perfect. It is clean, spacious, the service is outstanding and the location is great. Because it was our wedding week, we were too busy spending time with family and friends to be able to fully appreciate the hotel and spend quality time there. Although I have already been looking at booking another trip there - perhaps for our first wedding anniversary. I could type for ages about the qualities of this hotel but there is really no need - no improvements necessary with this place as it's perfect!! Room Tip: Deluxe Sea View; great views. Amazing sunsets. See more room tips'
