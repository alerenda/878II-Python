'I travelled to Cancun with my wife on a shoestring budget so I picked this hotel. I didn't care much about hotel amenities since we were going to be travelling to Isla Mujeres, Tulum and Chichen-Itza. The hotel worked out for us because we had a rental car, but it is far from the hotel zone and it is not in a nice part of town. If you do not have a rental car, I would not recommed that you stay at this hotel. On the other hand, it is a block away from the Ultramar ferry terminal, so it is in a great location if you want to spend the day in Isla Mujeres. It is literally across a well-stocked convenience store (Oxxo) so it is perfect for those budget travellers who don't want to spend a fortune at restaurants for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. There is also a seafood restaurant right across the street named "Mandingas" that has great ceviche and the prices are very good. In the mornings the hotel has free cereal, toast and oj for breakfast. Although the hotel is very clean, the beds are hard, that may be intolerable to those extra sensitive people. They have wifi internet access in the lobby and if you don't have a laptop, they have access to a computer, but it is dated and should be replaced. Technically, the hotel is right by the ocean, but it is not on the beach. There is a public beach about a 5 minute walk north of the hotel, but it is not the nicest beach and is used mostly by locals. The hotel has a terrace with beautiful views of the ocean. Also, important to note, since it was Mexico, I felt very safe at this hotel. However, I would not venture out of the hotel (on foot) after midnight, because the ferry terminals are closed and the surrounding neighborhood looks kind of gritty.'
