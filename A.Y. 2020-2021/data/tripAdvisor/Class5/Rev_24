'Arrived with two tired children at around 20:00 needing to be in Belgrave for 08:00 meeting next morning. Experienced seamless, charming and efficient check-in by Emmanuel. All terminals and lobby area busy, but sufficient staff on hand to cope. All questions about check-out and car parking dealt with satisfactorily. Room absolutely OK for an overnight stop to recharge. Received courtesy call in room ten to fifteen minutes after to check we were OK. Nice touch. Accommodation superclean. Comfy beds. If anything, kids and wife all woke up once to say they were too hot, but with London experiencing some of the warmest days this year sofar, this may have been an oversight from the engineering department. If not, the unit in the room (4050) may need servicing. Breakfast is busy, but seating expedited quickly and received good attention. Girls all loved the food. Coffee possibly a bit average tasting. Parking very convenient since good access to M4 and easy cab ride into town next morning. Charges for hotel residents are discounted. Collected car at 15:00. Can validate and pay at reception. Again very quick and pleasant service received. Thumbs up from the whole family.'
