'We stayed in this hotel the last week in March. We were a bit apprehensive after reading a lot of the other reviews We need not have worried as we had a very smooth check in and advised immediately that dinner was being served and we would be best just to leave luggage in our room and unpack later. Food was basic but good choice best to go at the start as the food is all carvery and towards the end food is not as hot. Our room was cleaned daily and fresh towels every day Pool area had plenty of sun loungers and a clean pool . The Hotel has a lot of long term holiday residents averaging at 5 weeks stay and most are elderly 60+ you can tell them as they all bring there own china mugs to breakfast for there mug of tea or coffee Our hotel room had a double bed bedside cabinets , wardrobe with hangers , T V and mini bar fridge and a ,safe. Small table and two chairs.You pay extra for the key to the fridge and key for safe if you want a remote control for the T.V. We also had a balcony with a table and two chairs. The hotel is very centrally located and within walking distance to all the areas of intrest The local bus station. stop for open top tourist bus , St Pauls bay Beach This hotel does not deserve all the negative reviews that some people have left and some reviews are very outdated.'
