'We were at Desire in Cancun February 11-15, 2011 for our 18th wedding anniversary. This was our first time at Desire. We stayed in an ocean view Jacuzzi Suite with butler service. It had lots of room and was only 10 steps from the beach. But there were no dressers in the rooms, so it was hard to unpack properly. The beach is small but you can walk passed the resort property on both sides. The beach beds are nice and close to the beach bar. The food and the service were both great. The resort was only a 10-15 minute ride from the airport. The sky-top Jacuzzi opens at 1:00PM and is very quiet until around 4:00PM. After that is gets packed. The pool was nice but full all day. The membership (timeshare) meeting takes about 2 ½ hours – if you have the money to pay up front, it is a good deal but if you have to finance not so much. We had a great time and will return.'
