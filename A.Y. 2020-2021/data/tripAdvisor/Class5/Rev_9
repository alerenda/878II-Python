'We stayed here for a few nights. Mama Celeste was super friendly. The space was beautiful and pleasant. The only problem was that we had no hot water in our shower. When we told them about the problem, they didn't fix it or follow up. It was a bit of a downer not having hot water especially in early March when it was rather brisk and the house was pretty cold. Otherwise a nice place.'
