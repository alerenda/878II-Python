'My husband and I thought that this was unreal value. Free Valet parking, the room was enormous. We only stayed 1 night so didn't have the opportunity to use the pool or go on the gondolas. My 9 year old son was not so impressed because there wasn't any room to put your own goods in the fridge and well Vegas just wasn't quite as good for kids! The location is brilliant. We did enjoy the bathroom - it even had a t.v! They have the best beds in the world. Oh and the 9 year old was still impressed enough to have a bath whilst watching t.v!'
