'My wife and I stayed at the Elysium Paphos during the first 2 weeks of June 2011 and had a very enjoyable time. We booked a room in the part of the hotel called the Megaron (Royal Studios) (adults only), the room was spacious, clean and comfortable and the bathroom was well appointed and again large. When we arrived in our room we found a bottle of red wine, chilled sparkling white wine and a bowl of fresh fruit on the coffe table courtesy of the hotel. The fresh fruit was replaced everyday but sadly not the wine. Being accomodated in the Megaron gave us the use of the Royal Pool and the benefits thereof such as freshly cut chilled fruit served between 3 & 4pm everyday plus poolside waiter service. The food in the hotels many restaurants was plentiful, good quality and well presented. The hotel staff were polite, cheerful, ready to help in anyway possible and always available. Should we wish to travel there was a bus service 5 minutes walk from the hotel or a taxi service in the hotel forecourt, a 35/40 minute walk could take you along the coastal path into Paphos Kato and the old harbour with it's restaurants and bars.We found the prices in the hotel to be comparable with other 5 star hotels and less than some UK 3 star establishments. We definitely plan to return and would highly recommend for couples. Room Tip: Go for Royal studios apartment/rooms See more room tips'
