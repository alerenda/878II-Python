'B&B is run by an elderly italian couple who went out of their way to make us feel at home. Although they didnt speak too much english they were very friendly and helpful and took time to answer our many questions. 2 star rating does not truly reflect the quality of this hotel. Good location (although everything is Positano involves climbing some hills) and furnishings. Rooms were very clean and all come with balconies to allow you to sit out and take in the views of Positano and the surrounding hills. Reasonably priced. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends and family.'
