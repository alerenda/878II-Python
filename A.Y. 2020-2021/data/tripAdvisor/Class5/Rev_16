'We (re)stayed in this hotel during the winter - On the south side, you will find very large room (45 sq m) with a large sunny balcony - Rooms were just refurbished (carpet, walls, curtains and bathroom) but are still German swiss urban style. On the North side, rooms are much smaller but cheaper. Hotels and restaurants managers are wonderful - Should you need something just ask -International waiters are from the best Swiss restaurant schools. Cuisine is French sofisticated one with some Swiss touchs. Location of the hotel just above the city centre is fine and near ski areas. - Swimingpool is hot and great. A quited hotel too - So the best place to stay in Villars!!!'
