'I went touring sicily in february/march 2011 and i must say that i would recommend this villa to anyone willing to explore this magic island.Not only is it ideally situated for people willing to see the sicilian highlights but also and foremost the owners are first class.Sergio is very friendly and most helpful and nothing is too much for him.In brief i just didn't want to leave when i had to and even prolonged my stay.'
