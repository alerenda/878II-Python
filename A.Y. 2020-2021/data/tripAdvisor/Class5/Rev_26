'Stayed only one night but could not fault service ,accommodation, food etc Air conditioning seemed to be working OK ( Room 3056 ) Convenient for our purpose. Have stayed with the Accor group on previous occasions but not at this Hotel, and have always been satisfied. Only minor disapointment for my wife (Diabetic) they did not appear to have any Marmite.'
