'We were put into Room 219. It was very clean and spacious. The king-sized bed was very comfortable and the sheets very soft. We checked... no bed bugs like the other reviewers have stated. It was a little loud at night with the bar across the street, but the air conditioning drowned some of the noise. Huge, long windows looking onto the traffic circle and life in Cancun. A good value, modern, spacious bathroom. I would stay here again.'
