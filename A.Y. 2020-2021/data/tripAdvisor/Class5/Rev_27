'My wife and I stayed with Peter and Michelle for the second year in a row. This is a fabulous value. We had a view of the Caribbean and lagoon with a terrace for each. All this for $99 a night on the best beach in Cancun, wide beautiful beach. The tile and granite are beautiful. I read a criticism of these condos, but I don't get it. No, you don't get cleaning everyday, waited on hand and foot, or a turn down, but what are you expecting? If you want that service be prepared to pay for it. we stay with Peter and Michelle because we know it is an excellent value, clean, a great location and Michelle will take care of any need you may have. You just gotta ask.I have literally paid more to view an interstate.'
