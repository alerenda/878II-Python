'My expectations were exceeded with this condo. The staff was helpful, the maid was fantastic (she even cleaned our dishes!), the location was the BEST, and the room was gorgeous. It looks even better in person than in the pictures!!And Paula (condo owner) was really great to coordinate with. We hope to come back again soon!'
