'We got married in Cyprus on 3 June and chose The Elysium as it came highly recommended by a friend. Oh my god! It was amazing. What a place to spend your honeymoon! On arrival your luggage is whisked off for you and you are sat down with in the grand foyer with welcome drinks before being escorted to your room. We had a family suite which was basically 2 deluxe rooms. We had one room and our 2 children were next door. Rooms were spacious, comfortable and well equipped. We were B&B and the breakfast was lovely - SO much choice and of very good quality. Everything you could imagine was on offer from your traditional english to cereals, fruit, pastries, pancakes, yogurt, smoked salmon, champagne - the list was endless. The Pool area again was lovely - various pools to swim in, a kids pool which was sheltered, hydro pool, pool bar. From the pool area is a big grassed area was was very well kept and looked out to sea. The hotel has a private beach which is quite small but quiet and tucked away. There is also a kids play area on grass which was clean, safe and ideal to entertain the kids for half an hour. The staff at The Elysium cannot do enough for you from putting your towel on the sun bed to opening umbrellas and bringing you frozen flannels in the afternoon sun. All staff were polite and very helpful. I used the hotels Hair and Beauty Salon for my wedding day and the girls were lovely and friendly, making sure I had everything exactly as I wanted it. We had a wonderful time at The Elysium and would definitely return. My parents and sister and her family also stayed there and we were all in agreement about what a great hotel it is. An amazing holiday!!! Didnt want to come home.'
