'I'm writing this review in English, even if I'm Italian, because I think it's just fair to get English speakers to hear another voice on il Bacio del Sole. The place is absolutely fantastic and we loved it! We got to Nocelle a bit later then expected - I wasn't exactly sure where the village was - but the owner waited for us and kindly showed us to our room and did everything to make us fell welcome. She found information on a trip we were thinking of doing, introduced the different things we could do/see around, and left us her number for any further question we may have (we actually called her once and she did answer her phone). The room we had - no 5 I think - was big and airy and full of light and had this lovely private garden/terrace with beautiful views over the sea and Positano. I can't see how the garden there could not feel private: it's really enclosed and full of plants and flowers. We enjoyed having breakfast there, so much so than we even had dinner in under the stars one night! The only thing I would suggest the owner to do is to cut a bit the plants on the terrace: they cover part of the beautiful view! On the downside the shower/jacuzzi door was broken in our room. This made showering a bit impractical and a lot of water would inevitably end up on the floor. Also, I do think the site should clearly state that the B&B is accessible only through a couple of flight of stairs, which could be a big issue for elders or people with kids; and that there's almost nothing in Nocelle in terms of restaurants or bars. We really didn't mind since we had a car, and also used the very reliable bus service, but I can see how this could be disappointing for somebody. Personally, we felt like we had found our own slice of paradise. All in all very happy with our choice and would suggest it to friends (if fit and with no kids)'
