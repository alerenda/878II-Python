'Just came back from our second trip and first after the remodel. Staff is still the best! Rooms have been updated as well as the showers. Anybody complains about the rooms is an unhappy person. The main update we saw was the new gym! Two high quality treadmills and elipticals. One wieght Machine and dumbbells. Keep up the great work!'
