'I stayed here the first and last nights of my whale shark adventure in Mexico. The flight times necessitated that I stay close to the airport. The hotel provided a nice, clean, air-conditioned van for free to and from the airport. The hotel was decorated nicely in Mexican tiles and style.. Staff was courteous, quick and spoke wonderful English. The room was very spacious and well equipped with a refrigerator, coffee maker and good lighting. Bed was very comfortable but the pillows were huge and I had to remove the duvet filling (who needs that in Mexico!!!!). My biggest gripe was that I asked for a 5 AM wake up call but did not receive it until 5:15! That meant I scrambled to make coffee, close the suitcase, and dash out of the room for the 5:30AM shuttle in order to catch my DELAYED flight (unknown to me!).'
