'Received a warm welcome from the owner on arrival and were shown to our rooms. My room was on the top floor (up two flights of stairs) and was clean, modern and well-decorated. The beds were comfy, with white sheets, cushions and a throw. There was a couple of chairs and a table in the window which afforded views over the street and the countryside beyond. The shower was powerful and a range of toiletries was provided. Despite being situated on a busy road, there was little traffic noise in the room, and blackout blinds kept street light out. The choice of food at breakfast was good and the ambience of the dining room was relaxing with pleasing décor. We would definitely choose to stay at the Kildonan Guest House on our next trip to Aberdeen.'
