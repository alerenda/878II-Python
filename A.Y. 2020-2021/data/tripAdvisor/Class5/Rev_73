'This is a small operation in a beautiful area outside Sedona. Basically three rooms each with its own cooking facilities. Due to the vegetation, only the "Amigos Suite" offers much of a view. It is on the second floor and has a great view of Cathedral Rock through the trees. No services and no staff. Management is just a phone call away. Property is up for sale so anything could happen. Sedona, itself, has turned into a total dump so being a bit removed is a huge plus. There is some great hiing near this location. You absolutely need a car. The property next door, about 30 feet away, is a rather unattractive trailer compound and the privacy fence had just fallen down when we stayed. I would ask if it has been replaced. Really can't call it a good value, but nothing in Sedona is! Room Tip: book Amigos suite See more room tips'
