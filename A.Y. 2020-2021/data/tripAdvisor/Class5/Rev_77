'I stayed in Unit H-3 at Punta Cancun Towers and had an excellent stay. H-3 is owned and managed by Diane. She was very approachable and professional and really contributed to making my stay exceptional. The Booking process was simple. Location and Grounds: Punta Cancun towers is located between the Riu Cancun Resort and the Fiesta Americana resort in a prime area of the Hotel Zone. You can conveniently walk to the clubs and shopping districts within the hotel zone. Bus stops are close to the tower as well. The Punta Cancun security and grounds are superb. The staff was always friendly, attentive and willing to help. The pools and landscape were clean and well maintained. The beach access was good to despite most of the sand taken by the hurricane a few years go. However just a few feet down from the beach access stairs is a great patch of sand to relax and play. Unit: The unit was on the third floor and offered exceptional ocean views. The unit contains 3 bedrooms. One Master king with bath and shared balcony with living room, One Two Twin bedroom with attached bath and shared balcony with room next door which is a Queen room with bath across the hall. A spacious and bright living and dinning area, kitchen, laundry room and storage room. The unit was exceptionally decorated throughout. The unit is well maintained and offers free calls to the US and wifi throughout. Experience: Five Star Comfort and security in an awesome location... what more could I ask for. I fell asleep to the sounds of the ocean every night... That was simply wonderful. I highly recommend this complex and unit. Just make sure you leave a week free for me because I plan to return to this fine jewel really soon. Room Tip: Unit H3 See more room tips'
