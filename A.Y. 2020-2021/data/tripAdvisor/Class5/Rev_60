'First of all, the owner is attentive to the property and most importantly, the guest. The room's decor is similar to a higher-end mountain cabin complete with wood floors, beams, absolutely beautiful bathroom, high quality linens and blankets, artwork that makes you think, "I love that-wonder where she bought it?", great tv with remote and all the networks you want to watch, great little "extras" like the shampoo and conditioner dispensers in the shower with that really great soap (wonder where she gets that?), awesome fluffy towels and clean, clean, clean!!!! If you're in town for the horse shows, all the shopping, dining and Saugerties' nightlife is literally 10 steps away. If you're traveling with kids, one of the rooms I stayed in has an "adjoining" option which would be perfect for a little peace and quiet. One of the rooms I stayed in has a mini-kitchenette with a fridge, microwave, sink, etc. Again, all up to date and so clean. Did I mention the complimentary Monkey Joe fresh ground coffee they leave for you? This is my favorite place in Saugerties and I highly recommend it to anyone coming to show their horses, meander along the river or simply play in one of the "Top 10 coolest cities in America". Love it!'
