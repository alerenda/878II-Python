'I booked Dunrovin Guest House after other places indicated that they were booked up several weeks in advance. The reason is the workers in Aberdeen's growing oil and natural gas industry. However, I hit pay dirt when I came across Dunrovin. It is fairly close to the train station, not far from the central city, and located on a quiet street. The room was clean; the bed was comfortable; the owner was very cordial; and the breakfast was superb.'
