'My wife and I stayed for two days over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend in April. After driving through stunning countryside and up a mile long ornamental drive we arrived at Rhinefield House in the late afternoon. The hotel is an impressive Tudor style building which, as the name suggests, was once a house rather than a purpose built hotel which makes it a little quirky in layout and certainly not run of the mill. Check in was efficient and professional (can't believe there is no charge for room service breakfast!) and the concierge gave us all the information we needed as he showed us to our room (he used to work at Buckingham Palace apparently!). The room itself was bright and clean, big plasma screen etc. I was told that refurbishment is happening soon but it didn't feel like it needed it. As it was a hot day we made our way to the outdoor pool and en-route we were welcomed by the bar waiter who offered drinks and delivered them to the poolside. Each day of our stay there was a wedding taking place but this was not intrusive and actually enhanced the atmosphere with so many happy people around! As we were looking to get a feel for the New Forest we dined out each evening but the Brasserie restaurant menu looked very appealing and not too expensive either. Breakfast is served in a number of small rooms which have a unique feel about them and it was nice to eat in a different room each morning. Service was efficient and friendly at breakfast, the poached eggs were perfect. On the second day we decided to have afternoon tea by the fish pond and it was lovely to be able to feed huge Koi Carp with bread as we sat in peaceful surroundings. Overall our stay was superb, the staff were attentive but not over zealous, it was good value for money and we will definately make this our base when we visit the New Forest in future.'
