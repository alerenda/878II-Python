'My partner and I stayed in this hotel for one night in Feb. 2011. Our flight arrived in Cancun in the evening and we were planning to head out of Cancun with our rental car the next day. We are budget travelers who are pretty much the polar opposite of the Cancun hotel zone type so our expectations aren't super high. This is a comfortable, basic, clean hotel; it doesn't have a lot of frills, but at approximately $30 a night it was fine. The only negative thing I can report is that I found the bed too hard to get a very good night's sleep on. Otherwise, it was fine- the staff were friendly (my partner is Mexican and we are both fluent in Spanish, so that probably helped); our room and bathroom were very clean; our room was spacious and had cable TV; there was free secure parking for our rental car; and we were across the street from a market area that had restaurants and stalls with lots of stuff for sale. We did see some guests eating in the common dining area in the morning (it looked like a free continental breakfast) but we preferred to head across to the street to some of the market stalls for breakfast. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for a long-term stay, just because the location isn't very interesting, and the beds are terribly comfortable (at least ours wasn't). But for one night, it was fine.'
