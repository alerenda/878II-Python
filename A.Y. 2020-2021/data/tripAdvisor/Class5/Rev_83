'We read all the reviews before we went and new the beds would be hard and boy were they! But the room and grounds were spotless and the food was the best all inclusive I have ever had. Several have complained about the broke tiles in the rooms but they are aged marble made to look like that. Besides the hard bed the ony other complaint I have was the antique exercise equipment, they should really but a few grand that way as the room overlooks the beach and could be great. We didn't have any trouble getting into any of the restaurant with the reservtion system and actually ate at one twice. I just called a few times between 8-10 every morning for the next day as they let you make them a day in advance and whatever time I wanted. On the day of my arrival I went up to the hostess and said we just arrived and they sat us right away w/o a reservation. Loved the suishi, fried cheese sticks, fried rice, wings and nachos all available by the pools. Kids loved the slides but you need closed toe shoes for the kids to do the zip line (FYI). This was my third trip to the area and first with the kids. This place is geared towards families but does have an adult only pool on the quiet side of the resort. If you are a scuba diver, its really cheap to go through the Aquaworld tours onsite. I did a wreck dive and reef dive for a total of $65.80 with rental equipment. Rented a car for $60 and drove to Tulum and Playa Del Carmen for the day and it too was a breeze! Enjoy your stay and enjoy one of the hammocks by the beach!'
