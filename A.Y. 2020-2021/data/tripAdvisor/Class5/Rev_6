'Just had a fantastic week at The Alphubel, The supersaxos are quite exceptional, offering a real friendly service, nothing seemed too much trouble and the in-house entertainment added greatly to our enjoyment. The views are superb, yet only a few minutes walk from the center. The free taxi to ski area and storage of gear at their sister hotel made skiing trouble-free. We can also highly commend Optimum Snow Sports, an English Ski School company, where we had some of our best ski lessons ever.'
