'Cancun February 2010 and 2011 Last February 2010 we spent a fantastic month at the Solymar Beach Resort in Cancun. Our hosts Michelle and Peter were wonderful. Anything we wanted or needed we received. This last February (2011) we had another wonderful month at Solymar. Our hosts had planned a few social gatherings. We met new friends, went out for great dining experiences. spent a day on a yacht, went swimming in the ocean, went on shopping excursions. Next year who knows, we might have to spend two months at Solymar. Jack and Donna Campbell Edmonton, Alberta'
