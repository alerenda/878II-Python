'The other reviewer described the villas perfectly. The location looking over the ocean could not be bettered, how wonderful to wake up to that view each morning. The grounds and the outside of the villas had great attention to detail, the photos on the website are just as it is. The maid service was excellent, we had serveral towel changes during our 10 day stay. Manuela the manager/caretaker was very friendly, she didn't speak much English but we got by, we pointed out a few things missing from the kitchen and she replaced them immediately. However, we did feel that the inside could do with a little attention. The shower was a dribble although it was hot so we could get clean, we didn't try the bath as it would probably take forever to fill. The beds were very hard and uncomfortable but I realise some might prefer a hard bed. The pillows were very small and lumpy so the sleeping experience wasn't too great. There were only about 6 hangers in the wardrobe. These things didn't by any means ruin our holiday but it would be nice to see a bit spent on them although we only paid £37 per night for the whole villa in April so we can't complain at the price. We too noticed that the walls were very thin and crying babies or rowdy teenagers were certainly heard through them but this was only on two nights. In our villa the twin room was not the room with the balcony which I think is sensible as children might be sleeping in the twin room. The twin room is a lot smaller than the double room but both have large wardrobes but there is no dressing table in twin room. Worth a note is the fact that the pool bar wasn't opened during our stay so its probably only open during high season but not really a problem. We've been holidaying in the Gale/Castello/Vale de Parra area for many years but villas Rufino was a new discovery for us and with the view of the ocean, I think we'll be back.'
