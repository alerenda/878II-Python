'The resort is very large. Lots of walking. Food was very good. The restaurant reservation system could use some flexibility. You had to make reservations in advance and if you were on a short vacation it did not allow any wiggle room if you found yourself interested in trying a restaurant, you could not override the system even if there was room at the place you wanted to try. The pools were great. The staff was very good. The resort was SPOTLESS! The shows were very good, but it was not easy to find out what was going on all day. At all inclusives that I have been to before you got a schedule every morning, I did not see anything like that here. I was promised an upgrade and did not get it, but the junior suite was adequate. We loved this place and would highly reccomend it! Room Tip: Ask for upgrade to platnium. See more room tips'
