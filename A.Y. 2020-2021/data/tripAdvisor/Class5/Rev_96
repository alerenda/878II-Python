'I stayed at Fraser Suites Singapore for more than a month during April/May 2011. This was a business trip and mainly chose Fraser due to its top class reputation in the service apartments sector. Spacious apartments with well done rooms. The staff and house keeping were very warm and welcoming and always ready to help. When compared with the other service apartments in the area, Fraser turns out to be slightly expensive, more because of its newly renovated swimming pool and gym area. Decent spread for the breakfast buffet and free daily shuttle services to Orchard Road and other shopping malls. One disadvantage is that they dont have a Memembership Program like most other hotels and are neither affliated with Starwood or similar programs. Needless to say that this would deter me from coming back to them. Ideal place for families and individuals who prefer to cook. The management also organizes events on a monthly basis - such as Singapore Zoo Visit, Bird Park Visit etc at very reasonable prices (cheaper than what you would pay at the ticket counter) and even includes pick-up and drop to the hotel. It is also conveniently located, within 10 minutes by cab from the CBD and Orchard Road areas. Overall a very pleasant experience. Room Tip: Ask for a higher floor room See more room tips'
