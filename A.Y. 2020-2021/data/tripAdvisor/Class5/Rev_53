'good location (right on the sea-front) very clean tidy, expected some entertainment but we visited old and new town for night life,benidorm has changed quite drmatically since our last visit 7/8 years ago,more high rise hotels and restaurants/bars lost a bit of its quaintness,food was not to our taste but it was eatable...'
