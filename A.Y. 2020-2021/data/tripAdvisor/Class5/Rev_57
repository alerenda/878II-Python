'My husband and I stayed in Studio d'Amelie for the first 3 nights of our honeymoon. We couldn't have been happier. Our studio was a perfect little apartment fully equipped with a kitchen, bathroom and backyard patio. We really found it charming here! The area in which Studio d'Alemlie is situated was our favorite part of Paris. Montmartre is a beautifully charming area filled with many cafe's, shops and a grocery store just around the corner. My husband and I love cooking so it was especially nice to have the kitchen and patio to eat on every day. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was a perfect size. Valerie was an extremely gracious host, helping us with directions and details upon arriving to Paris. Overall our stay here was perfect. Just as the last reviewer stated... it really is a home away from home. We recommend this studio to all travelers!'
