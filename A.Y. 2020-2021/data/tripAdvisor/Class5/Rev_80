'I stayed at Ramada for six nights early in June. It is well located in the center and easy to take a bus to the hotel zone as well. The service and food was excellent, and my friend and I were really surprised when we realized the hotel was only three stars. The food is good, the pool is nice and the room as spotless and comfortable.'
