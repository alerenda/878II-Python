'This hotel is a gem. Situated higher up in Puerto de la Cruz surrounded by beautiful tropical gardens and a great swimming pool. There's a very pleasant 15 minute walk down 200 steps which meanders through water gardens until you reach the old part of the town which has many fine restaurants (see my 2 recommendations). The rooms are large, functional and well appointed with generous balconies and good bathrooms with lovely outlooks over the mountains, gardens and sea. The staff were all very pleasant and could not do enough for you. There were a few let downs - the house white wine is not good and should be replaced and the food was not really to our taste (we did complain about one meal, but we given a full refund). The breakfast's are vast, lots of choice but tinned fruit and some processed meats are used and the bacon needs to be cooked much crispier. The food did not worry us though as there are so many great restaurants in the town. We also had to pay for a safe which seems a little petty for a premium level hotel and when we put our drinks in the fridge they were removed on the grounds that we had not bought them from the mini bar - it is recommended you hire a fridge from them if you want to store your own drinks. I have never come accross this situation before, but overall the i would return to the hotel as it good qualities more than outweigh the bad.'
