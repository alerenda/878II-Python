'The hotel is in a pedestrian area so be prepared to carry your luggage a little way but it is worth it for the amazing views from the roof top pool and the proximity to great night life. We were the only non Spanish residents the week we were there which meant we had great Spanish food from an extensive buffet selection. The hotel has recently been refurbished and although basic is quite contemporary and certainly clean. I will definately return as it is the perfect short break option.'
