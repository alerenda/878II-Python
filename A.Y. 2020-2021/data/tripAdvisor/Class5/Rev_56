'We chose Desire because we love being nude. We are not swingers, but are a fairly sensual couple. Desire was a blast and we will probably return. The food was the best that I have ever had. The omlets, steak, lobster bisque, sushi, OMG! It was sooo goood! The entertainment staff are fun and sexy. We loved Vanessa and Hector, thought they were very persuasive, we played almost every game! My husband was even crowned King of Desire for winning a Chippendale contest. LOL! We also won the love and marriage game (kinda like the dating game). When we first arrived, people were fairly distant, but once he won, everybody opened up and we met some really great couples. It was a little difficult at first, but once we met couples who also weren't swingers we had a blast. We also went on a party hopping tour to the clubs in Cancun. It was for a younger bunch but still pretty fun. The theme nights at the disco were loads of fun. By far the best were the beds by the beach and the loungers by the pool. We got up early enough to get ones in the shade! The hot tub is well, HOTTTT! Beware because that is where the swingers hang out. But overall it is fun if you are an open minded couple. Small and intimate and can be as relaxing or wild as you make it. Room Tip: book thru CheapCarribean.com & save a bunch See more room tips'
