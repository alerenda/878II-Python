'After reading some of the poor reviews for this Hotel, my wife and I (49 and 52) have been compelled to write our first short review; We are just back from our 5 night stay at the Hawaii Hotel (22-27 May 2011). The weather was perfect and we never saw a cloud during our stay. As many have already mentioned; the hotel location by the sea is excellent, and if you want lively nightlife, Magaluf is only a 10min walk away. We stayed All Inclusive and found the staff, service, and food to be one of the best experienced for a 3 star Hotel and we never once considered eating elsewhere. My favourite was the soup where I would often return for seconds! On entry to the restaurant I was pleased to see several busy staff ensuring that food trays were being refilled and replaced as needed. The staff worked hard in all areas to ensure that the Hotel and grounds were kept clean. The entertainment on a couple of nights could have been better but if you want a change there are plenty of other bars a short distance (5min) away. We paid a bit extra for a sea view but is looks as though you would be very unlucky to not get a sea or beach view. WiFi costs 4 euros for 24hrs, there are 4 computer kiosks, 1 euro for 15mins. We never usually return to the same hotel but overall a Hawaii return next year looks very possible indeed.'
