'We spent two days at the hotel and enjoyed their restaurant. We could relax in the restful and spectacular setting take hikes of varying degrees of difficulty and get plenty of good advice from the hotel service. We have taken plenty of trips around Spain and rank this hotel among the best if not the best quality/value. It matches the majestic site of some of the best Paradores but with a much better and professional service. The hotel restaurant is worth a trip on its own right, and the fix price hotel menu was even better than the regular fix menu offering. We certainly intend to make as many returns as possible.'
