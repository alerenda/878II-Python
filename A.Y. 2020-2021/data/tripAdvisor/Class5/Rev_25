'This was our third time at the Alphubel - last time was for our honeymoon. The Alphubel is in a great location with outstanding views over the village and over the mountains. The Supersaxo family never fail to entertain and ensure that our every need is catered for. They are a truly talented bunch, we particularly love the bell ringing and flag throwing. We always go for a south facing balcony room so we can sit out and marvel at the views and catch a few rays in the afternoons. Each year we return, the Supersaxos remember us and it is like we are returning to see old friends. We know that we are guaranteed a relaxing holiday at the Alphubel so will probably keep coming back - we have met people there who have been there every year for 20+ years. We are not skiiers but love walking and Saas Fee is a fantatstic place for this. If we could afford to, we would buy a place in the village and move here.'
