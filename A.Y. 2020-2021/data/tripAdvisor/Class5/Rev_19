'This is a delightful small hotel which is very well managed by its family owners who are very visible and hands-on, ensuring that high standards are maintained. It is in a beautiful, peaceful location with immaculate gardens and a very attractive heated pool with plenty of sun beds, mattresses, shades etc. Our third floor bedroom was spotless and comfortably functional rather than stylish. All rooms, corridors, and even balconies appeared to be carpeted so none of the usual noise problems of tiled floors. We had superb views of Mt. Teide and over the town to the sea. Food was generally good and certainly plentiful, with extensive breakfast buffet or cooked to order. The half board option for dinner was good value with 5 courses and good choice although we would have preferred fewer courses in favour of better quality mains. Whilst the fish mains were generally excellent the meat mains options were disappointing. The salad buffet was,of course, self service but it was relaxing to have the rest of the meal served. Good wine list and reasonable prices. It did seem strange, given the obvious quality of this hotel, that "standard" facilities such as in-room safe and tea/coffee should carry extra charges. The hotel is clearly not in the low-cost airline league!'
