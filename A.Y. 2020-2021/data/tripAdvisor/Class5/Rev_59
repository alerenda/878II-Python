'I and 7 other friends (all men) stayed 4 days at the Royal Mougins Golf Club Hotel. On behalf of all of us I can say that no one - ever - has been to a greater golf resort than this! Even though most of us has been travelling for years to golf courses/resorts all over the world. The hotel is luxurious, with very nice - not too big - suites for everyone, it has a great staff, great food but - first of all - a truly magnificent golf course. Extremely difficult - not long from clubtee but with a challenge waiting on every hole. It is like playing chess. One wrong move and you are in serious trouble... Great fun! Wonderful greens/fairways and beautiful landscape. I cannot recommend this place enough! Room Tip: Get a room at the first floor See more room tips'
