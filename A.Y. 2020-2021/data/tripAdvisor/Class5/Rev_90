'The Good Nice public areas and rooms ok but bathrooms need replacing. Breakfast was very good. Golf was brilliant, with a choice of courses and not busy. Pool area was as good as it looks on the website. The Bad You cannot easily go anywhere else to eat or drink without a car. There was only one place to eat with the same menu for lunch or dinner all week. Main restaurant closed in June Water is 6 times the price of petrol at 8 euros a litre. The fridge in the room is switched off so you cant buy your own and store it. I borrowed my friends Range Rover for the week and spent less filling it up at the end of the holiday than I did on water at the Arabella. There appears to be a lot of penny pinching here, having to request a turndown service, only one bar of soap all week etc. Things seem to be done to suit the hotel staff rather than the guests, in particular there is no urgency to make your room available before 3pm if it means changing the routine of the cleaners. Overall a nice place with some very professional staff but needs to have a rethink in my opinion.'
