'After having a negative Ibiza experience years ago we gave it another try and this time it was just perfect. The location of Ca Na Xica is wonderful, very quiet and only 5 minutes drive to St. Gertrude, a smal village, where are several good dining options. Carla and the staff are very helpfull and breakfast is delicious. Hope to come back soon!'
