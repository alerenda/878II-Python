'My wife and I took our grown up children and my father in law here for two weeks in June of this year. We stayed in the royal area with my wife and I having a royal garden suit. From the moment we arrived we were looked after wonderfully by the staff, the check in was done over drinks and away from the desk, we were taken to our rooms by golf Carl and had everything explained including the coffe machine air con etc, as we had booked bf and breakfast only they offered us a deal in the restaurants which proved excellent value. The food and service in all the restarunts was excellent, however for a romantic meal then the Bacco was difficult to beat. I can't fault this hotel it's staff or it's facilities at all! Room Tip: No children? Book the adult only area. See more room tips'
