'So we stayed in room 2802 and what a great room. Beautiful ocean view balcony and a lagoon view on the roof. There is a kitchenette which allowed us to prepare are own meals. A nice bathroom with two sinks. Overall this was great room for the price. What made the whole experience better was Peter and Michelle's knowledge of Cancun and their willingness to make sure you have a pleasant stay.'
