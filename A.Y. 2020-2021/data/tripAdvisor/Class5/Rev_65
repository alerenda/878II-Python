'Just back from a great weekend in Aberdeen, and the hotel was brilliant, the service, the food and the place was spotless, there was 7 of us 4 adults and 3 kids and they way our rooms were situated we were able to open the door to each others room so the kids could go freely into the rooms without having to go out the room disturbing the guests in the corrider brilliant - defintely would recommend it'
