'It was such a lovely experience to stay in Arkaig Guest House. It's like a home away from home. I had stayed in Arkaig in the of February too, when I first came to the Aberdeen. It was my second stay there in the month of May. Both stays were like WOW experiences. The best thing about the place is that it has such a friendly environment. The facilities are top-class. You'll find all the necessary amenities which are generally not found in the B n B's. I was amazed to see the bathroom fitted with the best possible accessories with 24 hours access to hot water. All the amenities were of superb quality. The rooms resembled the rooms of a 5-star hotel. Beds were amazing and the room had a fairly good lighting system with superb heating system. The room was full of amenities like coffee, tea, milk, hot chocolate and many more. The super speed WI-FI added to the pleasure of staying there. Last but certainly not the least, the breakfast provided was just amazing. You can have a wide range of cooked and uncooked things in the breakfast, the pricse of which is included in the room tarrif. All these facilities were provided at the same price that of the other B n B's (in fact lesser than that of a few B n B's). If you are coming to Aberdeen and thinking to stay in a guest house or even in a 4-star or 5-star hotel, Arkaig guest house is the place for you. It's simply an awesome place to stay..!!!!!'
