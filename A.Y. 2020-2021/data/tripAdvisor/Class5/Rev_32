'HI Moloch is a new hostel/hotel one block from ADO bus station, one block from Parque Palapas and one block from Ave. Tulum to take the R1 Bus for Hotel Zone. The Suites are on the small side but they are super clean, and with great flat TV's and satellite SKY. There is a pool, nice to have. Also, breakfast is included. Nice lobby with free computers to use, and Wi-Fi. They were not good with towels, one large one per room, but they were nice with everything else. The Hostel section is a year old, and the suites opened up recently. It is the best deal for the money. They even have free parking. HI Moloch is the best in downtown Cancun no doubt, the best value for the money. They should post pictures of their facilities, they are very good for all kind of travelers.'
