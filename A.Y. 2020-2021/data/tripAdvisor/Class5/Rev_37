'Just returned from a 5 day stay at the Covadonga. Had a great time as the hotel is not too close to the hustle and bustle of the center of town, yet easely accessible by bus and/or subway to where ever you want to get to. 25 minutes away from the airport. Very spacious room, in our case for three adults. Three very comfortable twin beds and a roomy bathroom!! Not luxurious, but spotless clean. Rooms were done daily at our request. Breakfast was a bit expensive especially for those of us who aren't used to a heavy meal in the morning. We didn't mind the room with no view since by the time we got back from our outings all we wanted was the comfort and space we got. I would certainly recommend and would stay again in this hotel!!'
