'This was our second time to Desire. and it was better than the first. The atmosphere for couples is outstanding and magical. The only thing to do there is to have fun with your spouse and that is great. What is best is the people-everyone is there to have the same experience-whether you swap or not it is great-no pressure for anything, and a relaxed atmosphere. The staff encourages you to convert fantasy into reality. Visit the playroom, the disco is so stimulating that it defies description. What goes on at the hottub especially during happy hour and after 10 or so cannot be described here. Just walking around the property naked is enough. The food is good-about cruise ship quality. The service is excellent, especially Africa and Rene on the beach. You can get a beach bed each am at about 7 with no problem. We did not use the pool much, if you want to socialize a lot that is the place. It is also more active. Do not go if nudity or open sex in places offends either of you. No one forces you to do anything, but you can do anything if you want. The bugs were not a problem for me, my wife had a couple of bites, bring a little spray. Some of the smell people discuss is from the swamp in the back where the crocs live. Not bad, and most of the time not even noticeable as the wind is almost always onshore. Never did see a croc, did not look too hard. There are a few raccoons and cats around. Most of the wildlife is human. Just go-if both of you want to it is worth every penny-no place in the world like it.'
