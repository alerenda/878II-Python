'My husband and I stayed at Creek Locks B&B for a short getaway. The B&B was very clean, beautifully appointed and had an amazing, organic breakfast. They even asked us when we made the reservation what we like to eat/drink so would be happy with the meal. The grounds are gorgeous and are in close proximity to many historical and lovely towns - great for outdoors, historical landmarks and shopping. We would definitely go back and would recommend to others. Room Tip: We loved the suite w/ very comfortable bed. See more room tips'
