'We stayed here for two weeks and couldn't really fault it! When arriving we upgraded to an apartment as we were self catering and wanted a kitchen, the staff did this for us with no problem. The room had a massive bed and lounge area, with a lovely view of the lagoon and stunning hotel grounds. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. The pool was great with a pool bar and plenty of sun loungers. The location of the hotel is perfect... just a short walk to the bars and restaurants. Overall, the hotel was excellent value for money and we would definately visit again! :-)'
