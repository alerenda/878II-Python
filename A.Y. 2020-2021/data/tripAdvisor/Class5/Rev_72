'I recently stayed in 3604, which Michelle tells me they call the honeymoon suite. It'd definitely fill that role well. Excellent view of the beach and pool. You can leave the balcony door open and listen to the waves. I spent a lot of time on the balcony or in the bed just reading with the waves in the back ground. The unit was very clean and well maintained. It's very quiet; no discos pounding your walls with bass at 2:00 AM. If you're one of those kind of people that likes to cook on your vacation, the unit has a kitchen and you can get anything you want from Walmart or Mercado 28. If you're more like me (I don't cook even when I'm not on vacation), there are many excellent restaurants for the next 10 KM on the road leading to Punta Cancun. Sisal was my usual stop for breakfast and was usually one of the first places to pop into my mind whenever I got hungry. If you're really not in a hurry and don't mind a little company, taking the bus is VERY cheap--8 pesos (roughly 80 cents) to get anywhere in Cancun. There's a bus every few minutes, but they stop frequently. So while getting on the bus won't take very long, if you're heading up to the area around Punta Cancun, it could take a little while. If you're not up for the bus, there is always at least a couple of taxis parked in front of the resort. And there seem to be about as many taxis as cars on the highway for when you're ready to come home. I never took a taxi while I was there, but it wasn't for lack of finding one. Michelle and Peter are great folks to work with and will go out of their way to make sure you have a great time.'
