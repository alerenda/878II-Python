'Cant really comment on the price of the hotel because the company paid so not sure what that was like. When I was staying here the lobby was being done up at the time so check was a little slow becuase there was a few less desks in the temporary reception downstairs. Overall the hotel was good. Its in a great location, about a 3 minute walk to Hammersmith tube station. Plenty of pubs and resturants nearby to choose from for lunch\dinner but you can always eat in the hotel. The buffet breakfast was fine but nothing spectacular'
