'Just returned from our stay at the Golf Resort and Spa together with my husband and two children (14) & (9) on Fully Inclusive basis. We had the most wonderful stay, the staff were very attentive through out. The spa area was small but ample, I had a couple of treatments in the spa which were fab, the views in the relaxation area after, together with the hot neck towels and refreshing fruit kebab were just the icing on the cake...I really could of stayed all day. The white orchid and the Italian restaurants are a definite must, as is the over 12's bar on the 7th floor in the main hotel. My daughter (9) loved the kids zone, choosing to eat there on the movie night rather than with us! Definitely, recommend hiring a car and seeing the sites, we booked our car rental with Thrifty on line using the hotel's internet rather than through the man in the main hotel and saved an absolute fortune.
