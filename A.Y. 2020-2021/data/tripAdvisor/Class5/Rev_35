'Le nereidi was everything we were looking for. The B&B is situated on positano hills and has an amazing view, really romantic. Everything was just perfect,the hospitality was magnificient, the rooms are clean, the breakfast was just delicious with variety of fruits yougurts, croissants...and of course an fantastic coffe everything enjoyed on the terrace overlooking the whole positano and the blue cristal sea. Was like to be part of a fable. The view at night is just fantastic too, with all the light and the moon shining in the sea is was just amazing.'
