'We have just returned from the Hotel Hawaii and what a holiday it was. The rooms are looking over Palma Nova bay and it is a brilliant view to see when you waken up every morning. The location is perfect as you can walk to all the nightlife in minutes but at night it is very quiet. The staff at this hotel are all extremely helpful, the bar staff are all up for a good laugh and a bit of banter. There is a great variety of food in the Dining Room which is amazing, the main courses, salads, sweets are all set out beautifully with staff checking over it all the time. Everything was nice and fresh.'
