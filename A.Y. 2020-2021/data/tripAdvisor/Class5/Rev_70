'Staff is very nice and got me to my room immediately. This is so much better than downtown Cancun. Please do not head in that direction. Their roads are not paved and by third world standards, it is not up to par. I am very satisfied I finally have air conditioner here at this hotel and I've been to the beautiful beaches.'
