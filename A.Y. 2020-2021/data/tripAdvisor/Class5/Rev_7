'In the beginning of january 2011 we took a month long charter from Sweden and had Clipper club as a base for weeklong trips around the Yucatan. On site we where upgraded to a bigger apartment because the hotel was not full ! It was clean and we liked that there were lot of sunchairs, especially by the lagoon where you can lie down and look at th "wildlife" away from all the retired people by the pool. I can really recommend this hotel !'
