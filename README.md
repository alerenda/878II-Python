# Lectures on Python

Series of seminars for the course of Data Mining and Machine Learning, MSc Degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering, University of Pisa

A set of lectures on computing with Python, using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks. 


# Setup guide

Download Anaconda from the [official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and follow the [instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) for your OS.

To open these notebooks in Jupyter, download the files or `git clone` this repository to a directory on your computer, and from that directory run:

```shell
$ jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new page in your browser with a list of the available notebooks.
